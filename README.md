</details>

<!-- Setup -->
<details markdown="1">
  <summary><h3>Setup</h3></summary>

  The first thing you want to do, is to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo){:target="_blank"}  this repository under your GitHub account.

  After you've successfully forked the repo, you will need to enable [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} in order to turn the repo into a website also.

  Here are the steps:

  1. Go to **Settings**
  2. Click on the **Pages** button
  3. Under **Branch**, select **main** and click **Save**
  4. Wait a few minutes, check that your repo is online and paste the URL on your personal progress sheet.

  The URL should look something like this: `https://your_username.github.io/WDX-180`

  > Here is a [YouTube video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqGlWAHjtcM){:target="_blank"} to help you with this step.

      - Windows: _
      - Mac: 212MB
      - Linux: 90MB
    - [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/){:target="_blank"}
      - Windows: 55MB
      - Mac: 115MB
      - Linux: 76MB

    > **Note:** During the course, we recommend using `Chrome` for developing and debugging Frontend web applications. For daily, normal usage we recommend using browsers that respect the privacy of their users, such as `Firefox` and [Brave](https://brave.com/download/){:target="_blank"}. Likewise, we tend to `Google` a lot for technical issues and searching for resources, but we recommend using an alternative search engine, such as [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/){:target="_blank"} for personal use.  

  - **Code Editor:** Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"}
    - Windows: 88MB
    - Mac: 203MB
    - Linux: 82MB
    - **Extensions for VSCode:** Throughout the course we will be recommending  a variety of VSCode extensions that can be installed and extend the functionality of the code editor and boost our productivity. 
      - One of the first extensions that **must be installed** is the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer){:target="_blank"}. 
      - Another one is the [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare){:target="_blank"} which allows for real-time collaboration. More to follow. 🙂
      - Last, but not least, you want to install our very own [WDX Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kostasx.vscode-wdx-extension-pack){:target="_blank"} which comes packed with recommended extensions and snippets that will you study and code better.

  - **Git:** Mandatory [Version Control](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control){:target="_blank"} software for the professional developer. [**Download here**](https://git-scm.com/downloads){:target="_blank"}
    - **Windows** users will also need to run the following command after installing git: `git config --global core.autocrlf true` as mentioned [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings?platform=windows#global-settings-for-line-endings){:target="_blank"}
    - In order to check that `git` has been installed on your system, you will need to run one of the following commands in the terminal: 
    - `git --version`
    - `git -v` (for short)

  - **Command Line Tools (Terminal):**
    - **Windows:** you will use [GitBash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash){:target="_blank"} _(which is bundled along with `git` so you don't need to install anything if you already have `git`` installed)_ as your UNIX-style command line environment.
    - **Linux:** _(Already includes built-in Unix command line terminals. No need to install.)_
    - **MacOS:** _(Already includes built-in Unix command line terminals. No need to install.)_
      - You will need to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/){:target="_blank"}

  > At this point, it's probably a good idea to spend a few minutes watching this [YouTube video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/S9Qg3Ltf__c){:target="_blank"} and follow along in order to create your SSH keys and connect them with GitHub, then follow the rest of the instructions to `clone` (download) the repository to your computer and install all the necessary dependencies.  

  - **Node.js:** Download the `LTS` version of the powerful and popular JavaScript running environment [here](https://nodejs.org/en){:target="_blank"}. You are going to be using `Node.js` **a lot** during this course 🙂. In order to check that `Node.js` has been installed on your system, you will need to run one of the following commands in the terminal: 
    - `node --version`
    - `node -v` (for short)

  - **Productivity:**
    - [**Wikiwand**: the Wikipedia Reader](https://www.wikiwand.com/){:target="_blank"} _(Install as a Browser extension)_
      - As you will be reading **a lot** (and we mean it) of Wikipedia articles throughout the course, we highly recommend that you use this awesome Browser extension to enhance the Wikipedia experience. In a sentence, this is Wikipedia on steroids!
    - [**Photopea**](https://www.photopea.com/){:target="_blank"}: a free, online image editing software that's pretty similar to `Adobe Photoshop`. You can use this tool to resize, crop or compress images among other things. 
</details>

<!-- Data Formats -->
<details markdown="1">
  <summary><h3>Getting familiar with data formats</h3></summary>

  In this course we will be working a lot with `Markdown` files and `CSV` files.

  **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text documents, allowing users to easily add structure and style using simple, human-readable syntax.

  **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** is a simple file format used for storing and exchanging structured data, where each line represents a record or entry, and fields or columns within each record are separated by commas.

  If you are unfamiliar with either the `markdown` or `CSV` file formats, we highly recommend that you watch the following 2 YouTube videos to get a better understanding:

  - [What is markdown?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f49LJV1i-_w){:target="_blank"}
    - Duration: 8 min
    - Level: Beginner

  - [Understanding CSV Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UofTplCVkYI){:target="_blank"}
    - Duration: 6 min
    - Level: Beginner
    - You can find the `sample.csv` file mentioned in the video in the following filepath: [curriculum/week01/resources/sample.csv](./curriculum/week01/resources/sample.csv)

  In short, CSV is a lightweight data format, where:
  
  - Each line of text is a single row
  - Fields (columns) are separated by comma `,` delimiter character  
  - The file contains just the data itself (along with the delimiter)
  - Does not need any special software (it's just a plain text file)
  - All spreadsheet apps (MS Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers, etc.) can read and write CSV

  <summary><h3>How to Study / Productivity tips</h3></summary>

  - **AVOID DISTRACTIONS at all costs!** This means, closing all tabs, browser windows and applications that are not related to your daily study plan and practice. Be very vigilant against applications that include notifications (WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.). From time to time, you might even consider **pausing notifications from Slack** itself. Check the [**instructions found here**](https://slack.com/help/articles/214908388-Pause-notifications-with-Do-Not-Disturb){:target="_blank"} on how to do this. 

  - **Go the extra mile** and go through the `Extra Resources` section that accompanies most of the chapters in this curriculum.

  - **I'm stuck!** Don't worry. Here are some tips to help you overcome what's blocking you:
    - ___I don't really understand this concept. What should I do?___
      - Search for extra information and resources online. (Found something useful that helped you? Make sure to share it!). We **highly recommend** that you always include [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/){:target="_blank"} in your searches for concepts related to Web technologies. You can google by including the `+MDN` keyword in your searches to find relevant pages in the MDN documentation, e.g. `css position sticky +MDN` or you can narrow and limit your searches only within the MDN documentation pages by googling using the `site:` operator, e.g. `css position sticky site:developer.mozilla.org`. Other channels for searching extra information include [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/){:target="_blank"}, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/){:target="_blank"} and [**other**](resources/PRODUCTIVITY.md#where-to-look-for-information){:target="_blank"}. 
      - Give yourself a break and try it again in a few minutes, hours, days.
      - Reach out to other students on [Slack](https://intechgration.slack.com){:target="_blank"}
      - Keep notes in order to discuss this during an upcoming support/Q&A session
    - My code is not working (as expected). What should I do?
      - Use the [rubber duck technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging){:target="_blank"}
