Now, let's briefly explain what each file and folder contains:

- **CHANGELOG.md**:
...
- **LICENSE**: This is the GNU General Public License (v3) under which the content of this repository operates.
- **user/**: This is the student's personal folder. This is where the student will store all of their personal progress data, code submissions and other related resources.

**Where can I temporarily store my own files?**

In our `.gitignore` we have an entry for a folder named `.personal` under which you can place any temporary files or folders.
