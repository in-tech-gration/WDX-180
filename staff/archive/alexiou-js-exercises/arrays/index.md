# Test your skills: JS Arrays

The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand JS Arrays. 

> **Note:** If you get stuck, then ask us for help!

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to:

- Create an array to hold your 6 most favourite foods.
- Iterate through the array using a for-each loop. For each favourite food, log to the console a string like: "My #1 favourite food is pizza."
- Get the second element of the array and log it to the console.
- Assign a new value at the third element of the array.
- Log the total number of the elemets of the array to the console.
- **Bonus**: Change it to log "My 1st favourite food is ..., "My 2nd favourite food is ...", "My 3rd favourite food is ...", picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is.
- **Extra Special Bonus**: Assign a new value to the last element of the array. The value must be an Object. The object should have a property foodName with the name of the food and a property basicIngredient with the name of its basic ingredient (e.g. { name: 'pizza', basicIngredient: 'cheese' }). Log the following string into the console using the Object you created as the last element of your array: 'One of my favourite foods is X and its basic ingredient is Y'.
