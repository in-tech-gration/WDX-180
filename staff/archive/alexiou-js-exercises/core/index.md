> **Note:** If you get stuck, then ask us for help!

## Task 1 - Numbers, Strings and Booleans

In this task, we want you to:

- Declare a variable using let, const and var. In each case try to modify the value and print the outcome to the console.
- Calculate the sum of 5 + 10, using two variables. Store the sum to a third variable. Output the result to the console. Your final result should look like the following: "X plus Y equals Z".
- Calculate the remainder of 29 รท 3, using two variables. Store the remainder to a third variable. Output the result to the console. Your final result should look like the following: "The remainder of X รท Y is Z".
- Store your birth year in a variable. Store the current year in a variable. Calculate your age based on the difference of the stored values. Output to the console the following string based on the result: "You are approximately X years old".


## Task 2 - Loops

In this task, we want you to:

- Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and print that to the console (e.g. "2 is even").
- Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
- Write a while a loop that runs as long as i is less than 10. For each iteration of the for loop, log i.
- Write a while loop that runs as long as i is less than 10, but increase i with 2 each time. For each iteration of the for loop, log i.


## Task 3 - Functions

In this task, we want you to:

- Create a function that prints your name to the console. Call that function.
- Change the function created in the previous task so it accepts the name as a parameter. Call that function.
- Create a function that prints you fullname to the console. The fullname should be a concatination of your first name and last name. Call that function. Your final result should look like the following: "My name is NAME".
- Change the function created in the previous task so it accepts your first name and last name as a parameters. Call that function.
