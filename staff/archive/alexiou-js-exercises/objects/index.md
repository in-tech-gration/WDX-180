# Test your skills: JS Objects

The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand JS Objects. 

> **Note:** If you get stuck, then ask us for help!

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to:

- Create an object with the name "person". The object should have a property named firstName with the value of your first name and a property lastName with the value of your last name.
- Add a property age into the object and assing the value of your age to it.
- Console log the following String by accessing the object's properties: "My first name is X. My last name is Y. I am Z years old."
- **Bonus**: Add a typeof Array property named myFavouriteSports to the object with your 3 favourite sports (e.g. ['football', 'tennis', 'basketball']). Iterate through the myFavouriteSports property using a for loop and log your favourite sports to the console.
- **Extra Special Bonus**: Add an Array of Objects property named myFavouriteBooks to the "person" object, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet). Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien". Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', and if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
