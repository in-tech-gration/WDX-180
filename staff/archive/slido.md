  Q: I'm doing the first exercise in the folder: exercise/1-parent-child and opened index.html, so here we have to make these changes and save or as usual to create copy and then commit and push?

  A: You'll have to copy the files existing in the folder and place them in the corresponding folder inside your user folder.

  For example:

  - Copy all files in folder 1-parent-child.
  - Paste them inside folder user/week01/exercises/day03/1-parent-child/ .
  - Work on the copied files and complete the exercise.
  - Upload to your repo.

  Q: got it thnx)

  Q: Why did we use git add . instead of git add user/week01/progress/progress.w01.d01.csv?

  A: By using "git add ." you tell Git to add for commit any changes you've made to files inside your current working directory. If the only file you've changed is "user/week01/progress/progress.w01.d01.csv" the two commands that you mention do the exact same thing. When you are sure that you want to add to your next commit any file changed in your current working directory, doing "git add ." is much faster than adding each file changed one by one. Do not forget to check the status of your repo (git status) after every command, just to make sure that there is nothing wrong going on! :)
