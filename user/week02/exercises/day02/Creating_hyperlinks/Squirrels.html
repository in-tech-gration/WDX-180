    <p>
      Squirrels are commonly thought of as tree-dwelling mammals, but the
      squirrel family extends far beyond that to include ground-dwelling rodents
      such as chipmunks and prairie dogs, and flying squirrels.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_squirrel" title="Sciurus vulgaris">Red squirrel</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_gray_squirrel" title="Sciurus carolinensis">Eastern gray squirrel</a></li>
    </ul>
