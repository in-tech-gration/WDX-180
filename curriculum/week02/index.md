  On the Internet, it's pretty easy for someone to intercept the data going from one place to another.

  ![](./assets/Comm.Insecure.png)

  That's why it's crucial to always use some form of encryption and decryption, in order for your data to be securely transported through the Internet. 

  ![](./assets/Comm.Secure.png)

  The same goes, of course, for the data that you exchange with **GitHub**. In order to open up a secure connection with **GitHub** and be able to download (`git pull`) or upload (`git push`) data, we can use the **SSH** protocol along with a pair of keys to lock and unlock data going back and forth.

  > [About SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh){:target="_blank"}: "SSH, which stands for Secure Shell, is a protocol used to open up a secure communication channel between computers. Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit."

  - **Set up SSH keys for GitHub.** Complete the following 4 steps in order to be able to access GitHub without using a username and password.

  1. [**Set up SSH keys for GitHub**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent){:target="_blank"}

  2. [**Check for SSH keys**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys){:target="_blank"}

  3. [**Add SSH keys to your GitHub account**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account){:target="_blank"}

  4. [**Test your SSH connection**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection){:target="_blank"}

  **TASK: Set up SSH keys for GitHub**. Once you have successfully completed all 4 steps, make sure to update your [progress sheet](../../user/progress.draft.60.csv) and mark the ` Set up SSH keys for GitHub` task as completed by switching the COMPLETED column from `FALSE` to `TRUE`.

  - [Watch: **Git Tutorial For Dummies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ-qvsxPHpY){:target="_blank"}
    - **Notes**: Make sure to **follow along** and run the git commands on your own repo. ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** The repository you will create under your GitHub account, **must be named: `gitVideo`**. Also, even though the author is using the old **master** convention for his repo branch names, you should use **main** instead: `git checkout main`, `git push -u origin main`, etc.

  **One important point to remember** is that the main branch in a git repository these days is called, ...well `main`. A few years back, the main branch used to be called `master`, so expect to see this term in various videos and tutorials. You should stick with `main`, by the way. There are no masters here. üôÇ

### Study Plan

  **What you'll learn:**

  During Week 1, we covered some of the [basics of HTML](../week01/resources/HTML_Basics/index.md). 
  Now, it's time to dive deeper into HTML. 

  HTML elements can be distinguished by default into 2 broad categories, **block** and **inline** elements. This fundamental display property of HTML elements, affects their placement on the page and how they stack against each other. 

  Check this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHjoohto2-w) to learn about this display property of HTML elements and then head over to [**https://htmlreference.io/**](https://htmlreference.io/) to discover various block and inline elements, by unchecking all categories at the top, and selecting either the **inline** or **block** checkboxes. Once you've checked either of these categories to filter HTML elements, open up a couple of those elements and have a look at their syntax, use cases, available attributes and how they are displayed on a web page.

  **Accessibility**

  Learning some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is useful if you want to become a web developer. Beyond mechanical use, it's important to learn how to use these technologies **responsibly** so that all readers might use your creations on the web. To help you achieve this, this module will cover general best practices (which are demonstrated throughout the HTML, CSS and JavaScript topics), [cross browser testing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing){:target="_blank"}, and some tips on enforcing accessibility from the start. We'll cover accessibility in special detail. This is probably the **most important aspect of web development**.

  **Overview**

  When someone describes a site as "accessible", they mean that any user can use all its features and content, regardless of how the user accesses the web ‚Äî even and especially users with physical or mental impairments.

  - Sites should be accessible to keyboard, mouse, and touch screen users, and any other way users access the web, including screen readers and voice assistants like Alexa and Google Home.
  - Applications should be understandable and usable by people regardless of auditory, visual, physical, or cognitive abilities.
  - Sites should also not cause harm: web features like motion can cause migraines or epileptic seizures.

  **By default, HTML is accessible, if used correctly.** Web accessibility involves ensuring that content remains accessible, regardless of who and how the web is accessed.

  The Browser Accessibility developer tools (like for example the Firefox Accessibility Inspector or the Chrome DevTools Accessibility panel) are very useful tools for checking out accessibility issues on web pages. The following video provides a nice introduction to the Firefox Accessibility Inspector:

  - [Watch: **Understand Website Accessibility with the Firefox Accessibility Inspector**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mqqgIxX_NU)
    - Description: When building a website, understanding what's happening with accessibility can help you make certain your site can be used by everyone. Firefox DevTools now has a new Accessibility Inspector that shows an outline of the accessibility tree, and lists problems with contrast or missing labels, and much more. Jen Simmons gives you a tour.
    - Duration: 8min

  - [Watch: **Which airline apps fail blind people? - Which?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUfM2IeZp54) to understand more about why Accessibility matters and why your responsibility as a web developer is crucial to the well-being of other human beings.

  - [Read: **What is accessibility?**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility){:target="_blank"}
    - Description: This article starts off the module with a good look at what accessibility is ‚Äî this includes what groups of people we need to consider and why, what tools different people use to interact with the web, and how we can make accessibility part of our web development workflow.

  - [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML){:target="_blank"}
    - Description: A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making sure the correct HTML elements are always used for the correct purpose. This article looks in detail at how HTML can be used to ensure maximum accessibility.

  - Watch as many lessons as you can from the [Start Building Accessible Web Applications Today](https://egghead.io/courses/start-building-accessible-web-applications-today){:target="_blank"} excellent excellent series of video tutorials by Marcy Sutton.

  Now it's time to gather all this knowledge around HTML _(and GitHub)_, build your own (accessible) Blog and take it online. Follow the instructions found [here](./exercises/lets_create_a_weblog/index.md). You might need to spend a few extra hours during the weekend to improve and finalize your Blog.

  Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheets are found in the `/user/weekXX/progress` folder, for example `user/week01/progress/progress.draft.w01.d01.csv`. You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](../week01/resources/PROGRESS-WORKFLOW.md).
