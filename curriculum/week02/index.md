  - **Linux/Unix:** Run `ls -a` to list all files and folders (including hidden ones) 
  - **VSCode:** How to show particular hidden folders: File > Preferences > Settings: type "exclude" > Hover over the `**/.git` and click X to delete
  - **Windows 11 (File Explorer):**
    - Open `File Explorer` from the taskbar
    - Select `View > Show > Hidden items` 
  - **Windows 10 (File Explorer):** 
    - Open `File Explorer` from the taskbar 
    - Select `View > Options > Change folder and search options`
    - Select the `View` tab and, in `Advanced settings`, select `Show hidden files, folders, and drives` and OK.

  On the Internet, it's pretty easy for someone to intercept the data going from one place to another.

  ![](./assets/Comm.Insecure.png)

  That's why it's crucial to always use some form of encryption and decryption, in order for your data to be securely transported through the Internet. 

  ![](./assets/Comm.Secure.png)

  The same goes, of course, for the data that you exchange with **GitHub**. In order to open up a secure connection with **GitHub** and be able to download (`git pull`) or upload (`git push`) data, we can use the **SSH** protocol along with a pair of keys to lock and unlock data going back and forth.

  > [About SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh): "SSH, which stands for Secure Shell, is a protocol used to open up a secure communication channel between computers. Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit."

  - **Set up SSH keys for GitHub.** Complete the following 4 steps in order to be able to access GitHub without using a username and password.

  1. [**Set up SSH keys for GitHub**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

  2. [**Check for SSH keys**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)

  3. [**Add SSH keys to your GitHub account**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

  4. [**Test your SSH connection**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection)

  **TASK: Set up SSH keys for GitHub**. Once you have successfully completed all 4 steps, make sure to update your [progress sheet](../../user/progress.draft.60.csv) and mark the ` Set up SSH keys for GitHub` task as completed by switching the COMPLETED column from `FALSE` to `TRUE`.

  - [Watch: **Git Tutorial For Dummies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ-qvsxPHpY)
    - **Notes**: Make sure to **follow along** and run the git commands on your own repo. ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** The repository you will create under your GitHub account, **must be named: `gitVideo`**.

        </ul>
      </details>

  **One important point to remember** is that the main branch in a git repository these days is called, ...well `main`. A few years back, the main branch used to be called `master`, so expect to see this term in various videos and tutorials. You should stick with `main`, by the way. There are no masters here. üôÇ

  **Repetitio est mater studiorum:** "Repetition is the mother of learning". Let's recap those git concepts by revisiting them through another (longer) and more in-depth video about Git.

### Summary

  - **What is Version Control?** The management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.
  - **What is Git?** A free and open source version control system.

### Exercises

  Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheets are found in the `/user/weekXX/progress` folder, for example `user/week01/progress/progress.draft.w01.d01.csv`. You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](../week01/resources/PROGRESS-WORKFLOW.md).

  **What you'll learn:**

  - Structuring Tabular Data using HTML Tables
  - Accessibility considerations for HTML Tables

  **HTML Tables**

  A very common task in HTML is structuring tabular data, and it has a number of elements and attributes for just this purpose. Coupled with a little [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS){:target="_blank"} for styling, HTML makes it easy to display tables of information on the web such as your school lesson plan, the timetable at your local swimming pool, or statistics about your favorite dinosaurs or football team. This module takes you through all you need to know about structuring tabular data using HTML.

  **Prerequisites**

  Before starting this module, you should already have covered the basics of HTML _(see previous Modules)_. 

  **Guides**
