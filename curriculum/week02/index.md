### Schedule

### Study Plan

  **What you'll learn:**

  - Basic Git concepts
  - Basic Git commands
  - Create a GitHub repository

  ---

  - **Set up SSH keys for GitHub.** Complete the following 4 steps in order to be able to access GitHub without using a username and password.

  > [About SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh): "Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit."

  1. [**Set up SSH keys for GitHub**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

  2. [**Check for SSH keys**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)

  3. [**Add SSH keys to your GitHub account**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

  4. [**Test your SSH connection**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection)

  **TASK: Set up SSH keys for GitHub**. Once you have successfully completed all 4 steps, make sure to update your [progress sheet](../../user/progress.draft.60.csv) and mark the ` Set up SSH keys for GitHub` task as completed by switching the COMPLETED column from `FALSE` to `TRUE`.

  - [Watch: **Git Tutorial For Dummies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ-qvsxPHpY)
    - **Notes**: Make sure to **follow along** and run the git commands on your own repo. ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** The repository you will create under your GitHub account, **must be named: `gitVideo`**.

          <li>git push origin master</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

  **One important point to remember** is that the main branch in a git repository these days is called, ...well `main`. A few years back, the main branch used to be called `master`, so expect to see this term in various videos and tutorials. You should stick with `main`, by the way. There are no masters here. üôÇ

  - **‚è∞ Time for a short break** (~5-10min) before the next longer video.

  **Repetitio est mater studiorum:** "Repetition is the mother of learning". Let's recap those git concepts by revisiting them through another (longer) and more in-depth video about Git.

  - You can find a nice reference to the git commands mentioned in the videos [here](resources/git-commands.html). _(Also, in [markdown format](resources/git-commands.md))_

### Summary

  - **What is Version Control?** The management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.
  - **What is Git?** A free and open source version control system.

### Exercises

  Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheets are found in the `/user/weekXX/progress` folder, for example `user/week01/progress/progress.draft.w01.d01.csv`. You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](../week01/resources/PROGRESS-WORKFLOW.md).
