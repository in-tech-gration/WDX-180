## Git & GitHub

- Check out the [Codecademy Git](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git) resources which contain pages describing some of the most basic concepts such as the [git add](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git/add), [git commit](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git/commit) commands, etc.
