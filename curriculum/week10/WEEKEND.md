# Week 10 Weekend 

These are some recommendations for a more relaxing but still insightful, informative and inspirational weekend. Enjoy!

- [Watch an interview with **Ivan Kutskir**, creator of **Photopea.com**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw5bNYfq4Kg)
  - **Duration:** 40min
  - **Description:** How do you go from a fun personal project to 100k per month revenue and 10 millions users? The answer is simple: faith in your ideas, consistency and lots of debugging! Watch how a Ukrainian developer created a clone of Photoshop in JavaScript single-handed and still providing the service for free to every body. A truly inspiring Dev success story.

  - **Duration:** 18min
  - **Description:** Another truly inspiring talk by Victor Pineda. A lifelong battle to prove the naysayers wrong and always _"imagine beyond what is not apparent"_. Totally worth watching.
