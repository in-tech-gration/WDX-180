### Study Plan

  ![](./assets/understanding.programs.png)

  This Module is about "Understanding Programs". It's not enough just to know the language features in JS. Before you can write good programs you need to learn how to understand code that you did not write. The following module contains a handful of sections that provide you a good amount of JavaScript programs and a lot of tools,methods and good practices on how to properly understand programs written by others!

  In order to follow the material, you will need to install and use the `study-lenses` tool. Follow the instructions from [**Setting up Study Lenses (v2)**](../modules/javascript/denepo/setting-up-study-lenses/index.md){:target="_blank"} to set up Study Lenses (v2) on your System (if you haven't done that already).

  **Launching Study Lenses and following the material**

  Once `lenses2` is properly installed on your system, you can go to your `WDX-180` folder and run `lenses2` with the material for this Module:

  - `cd WDX-180/`
  - `lenses2 curriculum/modules/javascript/denepo/_understanding-programs/`

  Now it's time to go through the material. For this Module you will only need to go through the following sections:

  - **0-let-vs-const**
  - **1-predicting-execution**
  - **2-reading-programs**
  - **3-plain-text-programs**
  - **4-describing-programs**
