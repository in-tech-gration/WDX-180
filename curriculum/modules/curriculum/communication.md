  Our main channel of communication is [Slack](https://intechgration.slack.com){:target="_blank"}. If you haven't received an invitation to the Intechgration Slack team, please inform us via email. 

  We encourage you to use the [Web version](https://slack.com/signin#/signin){:target="_blank"} of Slack on your PC/laptop and also have it installed on your smartphone. It's available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack){:target="_blank"} and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/slack-app/id618783545?ls=1){:target="_blank"} devices.

  In order to learn more about Slack and the various versions (mobile, desktop, web), scroll down to the [Software](#software) section.

  **Enrolled students** also have the opportunity to schedule one 30~45min call each week with an instructor.
