  <summary><h3>Setup</h3></summary>

  The first thing you want to do, is to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo){:target="_blank"}  this repository under your GitHub account.

  After you've successfully forked the repo, you will need to enable [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} in order to turn the repo into a website also.

  Here are the steps:

  1. Go to **Settings**
  2. Click on the **Pages** button
  3. Under **Branch**, select **main** and click **Save**
  4. Wait a few minutes, check that your repo is online and paste the URL on your personal progress sheet.

  The URL should look something like this: `https://your_username.github.io/WDX-180`

  > Here is a [YouTube video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqGlWAHjtcM){:target="_blank"} to help you with this step. 

  While you are at the **Settings** page, select **General** on the side menu and go to **Features > Check "Issues" > Save** in order to enable the **Issues** feature on your forked repo.
