  <summary><h3>Getting familiar with data formats</h3></summary>

  In this course we will be working a lot with `Markdown` files and `CSV` files.

  **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text documents, allowing users to easily add structure and style using simple, human-readable syntax.

  **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** is a simple file format used for storing and exchanging structured data, where each line represents a record or entry, and fields or columns within each record are separated by commas.

  If you are unfamiliar with either the `markdown` or `CSV` file formats, we highly recommend that you watch the following 2 YouTube videos to get a better understanding:

  - [What is markdown?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f49LJV1i-_w){:target="_blank"}
    - Duration: 8 min
    - Level: Beginner

  - [Understanding CSV Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UofTplCVkYI){:target="_blank"}
    - Duration: 6 min
    - Level: Beginner
    - You can find the `sample.csv` file mentioned in the video in the following filepath: [curriculum/week01/resources/sample.csv](./curriculum/week01/resources/sample.csv)

  In short, CSV is a lightweight data format, where:
  
  - Each line of text is a single row
  - Fields (columns) are separated by comma `,` delimiter character  
  - The file contains just the data itself (along with the delimiter)
  - Does not need any special software (it's just a plain text file)
  - All spreadsheet apps (MS Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers, etc.) can read and write CSV
