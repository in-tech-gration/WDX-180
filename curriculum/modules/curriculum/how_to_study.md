  - **AVOID DISTRACTIONS at all costs!** This means, closing all tabs, browser windows and applications that are not related to your daily study plan and practice. Be very vigilant against applications that include notifications (WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.). From time to time, you might even consider **pausing notifications from Slack** itself. Check the [**instructions found here**](https://slack.com/help/articles/214908388-Pause-notifications-with-Do-Not-Disturb){:target="_blank"} on how to do this. 

  - **Go the extra mile** and go through the `Extra Resources` section that accompanies most of the chapters in this curriculum.

  - **I'm stuck!** Don't worry. Here are some tips to help you overcome what's blocking you:
    - ___I don't really understand this concept. What should I do?___
      - Search for extra information and resources online. (Found something useful that helped you? Make sure to share it!). We **highly recommend** that you always include [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/){:target="_blank"} in your searches for concepts related to Web technologies. You can google by including the `+MDN` keyword in your searches to find relevant pages in the MDN documentation, e.g. `css position sticky +MDN` or you can narrow and limit your searches only within the MDN documentation pages by googling using the `site:` operator, e.g. `css position sticky site:developer.mozilla.org`. Other channels for searching extra information include [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/){:target="_blank"}, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/){:target="_blank"} and [**other**](resources/PRODUCTIVITY.md#where-to-look-for-information){:target="_blank"}. 
      - Give yourself a break and try it again in a few minutes, hours, days.
      - Reach out to other students on [Slack](https://intechgration.slack.com){:target="_blank"}
      - Keep notes in order to discuss this during an upcoming support/Q&A session
    - My code is not working (as expected). What should I do?
      - Use the [rubber duck technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging){:target="_blank"}
