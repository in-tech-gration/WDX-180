# Modals

## What is a Modal?

Modals are windows that overshadow or overlap the overall visible window. They are essential components in modern web design, providing a convenient way to display important information, gather user input, or showcase additional content.

HTML has a native `<dialog>` element for modals. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog){:target="_blank"} describes it as a dialog box or other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or subwindow. The `<dialog>` element, a semantic HTML element, has an open attribute that hints to the browser that the modal is active. Also, the HTMLDialogElement interface provides methods that help manipulate the `<dialog>` element.
