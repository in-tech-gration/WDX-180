### Study Plan

  **What you'll learn: Getting started with the web: HTML**

  It's a lot of work to create a professional website, so if you're new to web development, we encourage you to start small. You won't build another Facebook right away, but it's not hard to make your own simple website online, so we'll start there.

  By studying the material and following the instructions, you will go from nothing to getting your first webpage online. Let's begin our journey!

  - [Read: **HTML**](resources/HTML.md){:target="_blank"} to get a quick introduction to HTML. 

  - [Read: **What will your website look like?**](resources/What_will_your_website_look_like/index.md){:target="_blank"}

  - [Read: **HTML Basics**](resources/HTML_Basics/index.md){:target="_blank"}

          <li>Links</li>
          <li>HTML Entities</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
  
  Now, that we have a good grasp of HTML, let's learn a little bit about another markup language called **Markdown**, that is going to come in handy in a lot of situations.

  - [Read: **Getting Started with Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/){:target="_blank"}
    - If you found this article helpful, don't forget to give it a [GitHub star](https://github.com/mattcone/markdown-guide){:target="_blank"}.

  - [Take a look at this nice Markdown cheatsheet](https://commonmark.org/help/){:target="_blank"}
    - Take the [10 Minute Markdown tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/){:target="_blank"}
    - Don't forget to [give it a star](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-web){:target="_blank"}!

  Now it's a good time to bookmark this really useful website: [**htmlreference.io**](https://htmlreference.io/) is a free online guide to HTML. 
  
  Take a few minutes to browse through some of the available HTML elements, see them in action, check their syntax and the attributes they support. 
  
  Yes, they're quite a few of them (113), but don't worry too much though, as most of the times, you are probably going to need only a handful of them. 

### Summary

  Wow! You've covered quite a lot of ground right there! Through this module you've uncovered one of the most basic building blocks of the Web: HTML. The language that provides the content and gives structure to our web documents.

  You should be able to tell the difference between an HTML element and a tag, understand how HTML attributes are placed within the opening tags to provide extra functionality to the HTML elements and how nesting and hierarchy are important factors for a clean and well-formatted HTML documents.

  On top of HTML, you also learned about a very handy format, called `Markdown` which you are going to be seeing and using a lot in upcoming weeks.

### Exercises

  **TIP:** Before starting to with the HTML exercises, perhaps, you can spend a few minutes to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7wkAp9_bqw){:target="_blank"} which walks you through the process of setting up VSCode to efficiently work with the exercises.
