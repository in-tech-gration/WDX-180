title: "CRUD Operations in Express.JS"
---

### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** CRUD Operations with ExpressJS (Part 1) 
  - **Part 2:** CRUD Operations with ExpressJS (Part 2)

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week20/assets/day05/code){:target="_blank"}, the lecture notes [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/blob/main/curriculum/week20/assets/day05/code/NOTES.md){:target="_blank"} and the diagrams right [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week20/assets/day05/diagrams){:target="_blank"}.

  **Lecture Notes & Questions:**

  - The **fs module can only read files** of all sorts (even .js) but **does not execute** the code found inside these files!   

  - `JSON.parse()` will parse a JSON string but **will not execute any code** and cannot parse JS, only JSON.  

  - `Auth*`:  
    - Authentication (`AuthN`): let the system know **who you are**  
    - Authorization (`AuthZ`): let the system give you special permissions (**what you can do** on the system)  

  - NodeJS Modules: 2 ways of importing/exporting modules  
    - CommonJS: **modules.exports = {}** + **require()**  
    - ESM: **export + import**  
      - **Example:**  
        - `const express = require("express"); // CommonJS`  
        - `import express from "express"; // ESModules`  

  - JS/Node project setup:  
    - `npm init` and `npm install <module(s)>` => **ONCE per PROJECT**  
    - **Basic Express App setup:**  
      - `mkdir my-express-app`  
      - `cd my-express-app`  
      - `npm init` => manual process where you supply some basic information about the project  
      - `npm init -y`  
      - Recipe: `package.json` <= created by `npm init`  
      - Ingredients: express, cors  
        - `npm install express cors`  
        - OR: `npm i express cors`  
        - OR: `npm i express`  
        - `npm i cors`  

  - **QUESTION:** When should we use the **object literal** vs the Constructor (or a class)?  
    - `tasks.push({ content: “Learn JS”, completed: false })`  
      - Use the **object literal syntax** when the object structure is simple  
      - Use the **object literal syntax** when you are not handling too many instances  
      - Use the **object literal syntax** when you create the object in a few places  
    - `tasks.push( new Task(“Learn JS”) )`;  
      - Use the Constructor/class syntax when the object structure is **complex**  
      - Use the Constructor/class syntax when there is a lot of default properties  
      - Use the Constructor/class syntax when you are creating many instances  
      - Use the Constructor/class syntax when you are creating objects in many places in your code

### Summary

### Exercises

  - **Tracing the program execution** and understanding how each part works: Comment every single line of code in the example that we’ve looked at. Each comment should describe exactly what each line does.  
    - If any line of code is unclear or ambiguous, drop a question on Slack or leave a comment. 

  - **Convert function constructors into classes**: for example **function Task** can be transformed into a **class Task**
