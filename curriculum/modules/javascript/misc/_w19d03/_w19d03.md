### Schedule

  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  1. **Continue studying** the Node.js introductory presentation from where we left off during our last lecture: The `fs` module: [https://learn.js.org/learn/nodejs/introduction.html#/15](https://learn.js.org/learn/nodejs/introduction.html#/15){:target="_blank"}

  2. Make sure to read and practice **building a basic web server** using Node.js according to the [official document](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs#an-example-nodejs-application)_blank.

  3. **Install [https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode)** *(if you haven’t done it already)* **and complete exercises 3, 4 and 5 (MY FIRST I/O, MY FIRST ASYNC I/O, FILTERED LS)**  

### Summary

### Exercises

  - **Create a Nodejs app that displays a list of programming languages along with information about them (creator(s), date of birth, etc.)**  
    - `node lang.js` => be creative with the output 🙂

  - **Create a Todo App using Nodejs:**  
    - You should be able to run the app from the command line:  
      - *node todo.js “Buy milk”*  
      - *node todo.js “Go to the gym”*  
    - The app should then store the Task (“Buy milk”) along with the date in a JSON file (todo.json)  
    - When you run *node todo.js* (without any arguments) you should get a list of the todo tasks that are stored in the JSON file
