title: "React State"

### Schedule

  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Here's the recommended schedule for today:

  ```js
  const [ studyA, setStudyA ] = useState("https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory");
  const [ studyB, setStudyB ] = useState("https://react.dev/reference/react/useState");

  const [ practiceA, setPracticeA ] = useState("Complete the Traffic Light exercise (manual state transition)");
  const [ practiceB, setPracticeB ] = useState("Complete the Traffic Light exercise (automatic (timer-based) state transition)");
  ```

  - Remember the (React) rule: **State updates ===> Component re-renders**  
    - State updates via the `useState` setter function: `const [ getter, setter ] = useState();`
