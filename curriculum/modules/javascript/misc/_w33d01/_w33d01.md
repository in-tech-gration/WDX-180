  - Calculate SHA256 using the CLI:  
    - `echo -n somestring | sha256sum`  
  - How we store information in a relational database:  
    - **Find the Entities you need:** Think about the type of data you want to store (think *Entities*, the types of things we want to store: products, movies, students, transactions, accounts, gravatars)  
      - define Entity: *“a thing with distinct and independent existence.”*  
    - **Think about the specific properties that describe these Entities**  
    - **Create Tables for each of these Entities**  
      - **You have to come up a very specific and precise *Schema*** (aka Shape): boils down to number of columns, name of these columns and the data types (integers, strings)  
    - **Think and describe the relationship between those Entities**
