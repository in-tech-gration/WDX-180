### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** Web Storage APIs
  - **Part 2:** Web Storage APIs

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/blob/main/curriculum/week25/assets/day01/code/index.html){:target="_blank"} and all other assets [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week25/assets){:target="_blank"}.

  **Lecture Notes:**

  - The `localStorage` is a read-only property* of the window interface
    - Treat it as read-only.
    - It’s part of the `window.localStorage`
  - `localStorage` data has no expiration time (unlike cookies)
  - `sessionStorage`: data gets cleared when the page session ends — that is, when the page is closed
  - CRUD Methods for `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`: Create/Read/Update/Delete
    - `setItem()` (C)
    - `getItem()` (R)
    - `setItem()` (U)
    - `remoteItem()` (D)
  - _"key(): "The order of keys is user-agent defined, so **you should not rely on it**."_
  - Web Storage APIs work on per-[origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin){:target="_blank"} and per-browser context.

  **Questions:**

  - _Is it safe to store sensitive/private information in the browser’s storage?_
    - You have to be very careful about the things that you store.
    - Avoid saving sensitive/private information.
    - Try encrypting things before you save them.
  
  - _Will there be an error message when the storage limit is reached?_
    - Yes, we’ll get an error.name `QuotaExceededError`

### Summary

### Exercises

  Become a discoverer: Experiment and find out how localStorage works with different `origins` and when accessed from different browsers:
    - Configure [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer){:target="_blank"} to use a different default port (5500 => 5501) and see what happens with the localStorage. Also try both ports on a different browser. To find the setting, search for `liveServer.settings.port` in VSCode Settings, Extensions.

  **Coding challenge #1:** Use `localStorage` to keep track of a web page’s horizontal position so that when the user reloads or opens up the page again, they should be looking at the last section. For this one you’ll have to dig out some other APIs (related to browser scrolling, current cursor height)

  **Coding challenge #2:** Try localStorage with React. You might want to try `useEffect` for running localStorage.

  ```js
  // Read:
  useEffect(()=> { localStorage.getItem() }, []);
  // Read/Write/Update/Remove:
  onClick={()=> localStorage.getItem/setItem/removeItem }
  ```
