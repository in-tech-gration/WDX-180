### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** Asynchronous code and the HTMLImageElement
  - **Part 2:** Promises and more asynchronous mysteries

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week32/assets/day03/code){:target="_blank"} and the diagrams [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week32/assets/day03){:target="_blank"}.

### Summary

### Exercises

  - **Challenge:** make sure to start the game or display a Start Game button or run any code when ALL the images have been loaded. (game.js)  
    - **Tricky part:** how to **deal with some errors** that might happen. Example: make sure that some image URLs are correct (and therefore loaded) and some URLs are misspelled, instead of image.jpg, write image.jpgZZZ or iiii.jpg   
      - In cases like these, we tend to inform the user and act accordingly: retry loading the images that were not loaded, or run the code without using them.   
  - **CHALLENGE:** How can you get access to all the loaded images (when they have loaded) in the callback function?  
  - **CHALLENGE:** Try displaying a percentage loader while the images are loading.  
    - When the first one has loaded, show: 33%  
    - When the 2nd, show: 66%  
    - When all of them show: 100%  
    - Or use a loading spinner so that the users know that something is loading.
