  You can find the slides [here](https://learn.js.org/learn/nodejs/introduction.html#/){:target="_blank"}

  **Lecture Notes**

  - **Node.js vs Browser Environment**: The lecture highlights the differences between running JavaScript code in Node.js and a browser environment.
  
  - **Window and Global Objects**: The instructor explains how to use the `window` and `global` objects to distinguish between Node.js and browser environments.
  
  - **Type of Operator**: The lecture covers how the `type of` operator returns a string, and it's always lowercase, so you should compare with a lowercase string.
  
  - **Runkit Environment**: The instructor shows how to use the Runkit environment to test JavaScript code online and see the output in a nice HTML format.
  
  - **npm Packages**: The lecture touches on npm packages and how some can be run on both Node.js and browser environments, while others are specific to one or the other.

  - Use `window` to check if you're in a browser environment

  - Use `global` to check if you're in a Node.js environment

  - Be careful when comparing strings with the `type of` operator, as it always returns a lowercase string.

  - Some npm packages can be run on both Node.js and browser environments.

  - **window.document === document**  

  - **Ctrl+L** => Clear the console (both Node+Browser)  

  - When converting bytes to megabytes or gigabytes, use 1024 instead of 1000 to avoid incorrect conversions.
  
  - Use the `process.argv` array to access command-line arguments in Node.js.
  
  - Be careful when using the `fs` module, as it can delete files on your system.

  **Code Snippets:**

  - **Checking the runtime environment:**  

  ```js
  if ( typeof window === "undefined" ){ // switch to global  
    console.log("Should be run in the Browser");  
  }  
  ```
    
  ```js
  // Only runs in Node:  
  try {  
    global; // switch to windows for code that runs in the browser  
    console.log("Hello World!", 5 * 2 );  
  } catch(error){  
    console.log( "Sorry, only runs in Node");  
  }
  ```

### Summary

  The first part of the lecture discusses the differences between running JavaScript code in a Node.js environment versus a browser environment. The instructor explains how to distinguish between these two environments using the `window` and `global` objects, and how to write code that is compatible with both.

  The second part of the lecture covers various aspects of Node.js programming, including system interactions using the `os` module, process management, and file operations:

  - **Using the `os` module**: The lecturer demonstrates how to use the `os` module to get information about the system, such as total and free memory. They also show how to convert bytes to megabytes or gigabytes.
  
  - **Process management**: The lecturer introduces the concept of process management in Node.js, showing how to access command-line arguments through the `process.argv` array.

  - **System interactions**: Using the `os` module to get information about the system, such as memory usage.

  - **Process management**: Accessing command-line arguments and managing processes in Node.js.

  - **File operations**: (Not covered in detail) Using the `fs` module for file system interactions.

### Exercises

  - Explore the features of Nodejs (modules, REPL, etc.)  

  - Complete the tasks found in the comments of the lecture code (search for the `TODO` keyword).

  - Install [https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode){:target="_blank"} and complete the first 2 exercises (HELLO WORLD, BABY STEPS)  
    - [**Guide**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_HHcw85Nhs){:target="_blank"}  

  - Other tasks that you should practice on:  
    - Create an app that shows your systems total and free memory  
    - Create an app that accepts 2 numbers and adds them together  
    - Create an app that accepts 2 numbers and a command (add/sub/mul/div) and accordingly adds, subtracts, multiplies or divides those numbers. Make sure to move all the math operations in a separate module.  
    - Create an app that shows the time, e.g. node time.js  

  **Note:** Prefer GitBash in Windows for running node and other CLI tools
