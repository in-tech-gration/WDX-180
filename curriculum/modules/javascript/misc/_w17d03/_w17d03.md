title: "The Real Constructors & Prototype"
---

### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** Q&A
  - **Part 2:** The Real Function Constructors and prototype

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week17/assets/code/day03){:target="_blank"}

  **Lecture Notes:**

  - In HTML, placing a `<button>` element inside a `<form>` element, (automatically) makes the button a submit mechanism. When you click it, the form gets submitted to the server and the page reloads. That’s the *default Behaviour*.   
    - Ways to prevent a button inside a form submitting the form:  
      - 1) (HTML) Add a `type=”button”` to the `<button>`  
      - 2) (JS) Add an `event.preventDefault()` to the click handler of the `<button>`  
      - 3) (JS) Add an event handler on the form “submit” event and use the `event.preventDefault()` ( form => event listener on “submit”)   
  - The new keyword (always before a function call) turns the function call into a constructor call. The function that was called starts behaving differently (from an ordinary function call): **someFn() vs new someFn()**  
    - What changes with the new keyword?  
      - 1) We get a new object returned from the call (no need for return statement). Most of the times, we don’t want a return statement. The constructor always returns the object.  
  - Functions that are intended to be used as constructors (called with the new keyword) **should ALWAYS START WITH A CAPITAL LETTER**.

  **Suggested material for study & practice:**

  - Study the MDN article on [`<button>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#form){:target="_blank"} and learn more about it.  
    - What is the [form attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#form){:target="_blank"} all about?  
  - [Expressions and Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators){:target="_blank"}  
  - Study the [Operators’ Precedence table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_precedence#table){:target="_blank"}  
    - define **precedence**: *“the condition of being considered more important than someone or something else; **priority** in **importance**, order, or rank.”*  
  - Study about the [hidden attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden){:target="_blank"}  
  - Manipulate HTML attributes via JS: setAttribute( key, value ), removeAttribute( key ), [toggleAttribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/toggleAttribute){:target="_blank"} ( key ), getAttribute( key )  
  - [Off-by-one Error (Obi-wan)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Off-by-one_error){:target="_blank"}  
  - **Practice**: think of 3 different types of objects  
    - Declare a single object  
    - Separate unique and shared properties  
    - Define the constructor  
    - Define the prototype  
    - Just start simple and go more advanced with the 2nd and 3rd object
