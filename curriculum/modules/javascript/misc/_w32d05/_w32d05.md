### Summary

### Exercises

  - **Research and study the AAA**  
  - **PRACTICE:**  
    - Take the node.js file and handle a GET request. When a simple GET request gets in, respond back with a text/html type and send back a simple HTML page with a form (having two input fields, email, password)  
    - Once you submit the form an HTTP POST request will be made to the server.  
      - Handle this POST request (almost done for you) and send a message back to the user. You can send them back their own information for confirmation.  
  - Study and practice based on this article: [**A really simple example of TDD in JavaScript**](https://learnitmyway.com/tdd-example/){:target="_blank"}  
  - **Try to find and practice on the “99 bottles of beer” song test**  
    - [**Sandi Metz**](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles-sample-js){:target="_blank"} has some great workshops
