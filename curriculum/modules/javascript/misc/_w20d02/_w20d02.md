### Schedule

  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Here's the plan for today: **build things!**

  Scroll down to the `Exercises` section and start coding.

### Summary

### Exercises

  - 1) Create a basic Nodejs Webserver that serves a simple HTML form with an email and password input fields. You must be able to login successfully using the email "admin@gmail.com" and password "1234" and land on an admin page (be creative) otherwise get redirected to an unauthorized page.

  - 2) Try out the fetch API in Node.js: replace `kostasx` with your GitHub username

  ```js
  const URL = "https://api.github.com/users/kostasx";
  fetch(URL)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      // console.log the name, company and location from the data
      // In the following format "<name> is currently working at <company> and is based in <location>", example "Kostas Minaidis is working at Intechgration.io and is based in Athens, Greece / Berlin, Germany"
    })
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
  ```

  - 3) Integrate the above code into a [web server](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs#an-example-nodejs-application){:target="_blank"}. 

  - 4) Create another Nodejs Web server that displays fetches and displays jokes from the following API:

    - [https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming){:target="_blank"}
    - [https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/){:target="_blank"}

  - 5) [Download this JSON](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/blob/main/curriculum/week20/assets/day02/countries.json){:target="_blank"} and create a Nodejs webserver that accepts a request through the URL with the name of a country and searches through the JSON to find information for that country. It then sends back the appropriate object to the client in either JSON or HTML format

  - 💡 Remember to always handle errors in a graceful and informative manner: `console.log(error)` is not enough! ⚠️

  ```js
  const result = await fetch(url)
      .then((response) => { return response.json(); })
      .then((data) => { return data; })
      .catch((err) => { console.log(err); }); // <= This one should also return something useful back
  ```
