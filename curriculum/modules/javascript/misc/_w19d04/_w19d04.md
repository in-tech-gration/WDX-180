  It's time to continue practicing your `Node.js` skills using `learnyounode`.

  Make sure that you have the package installed, up and running via `learnyounode` in the terminal. We suggest that you complete the following 4 steps:

  - My first I/O
  - My first async I/O
  - Filtered LS
  - Make it Modular

  Today, we also suggest to focus on the `fs` module and practice what you've learned yesterday.

  Questions? Cool things that you've learned? Post them on Slack or in the comments section below.

  Above all, enjoy!
