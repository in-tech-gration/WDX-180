### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** TypeScript & Testing FTW
  - **Part 2:** TypeScript & Testing FTW

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week32/assets/day01/code){:target="_blank"}

  **Lecture Notes & Questions:**

  - **TypeScript + React:**  
    - **How to define types for hooks:**  
      - `const r = useState<POSSIBLE_TYPES_HERE>(INITIAL_VALUE)`  
      - `const r = useState<string|null|number>(null)`  
      - `const r = useRef<HTMLFormElement|null>(null)`  
  - `(method) ParentNode.querySelector<Element>(selectors: string): Element | null (+4 overloads)`  
    - This is the TypeScript *signature* for the `documentQuerySelector()`  
    - **ParentNode:** this is the TS type for the Object that contains this method  
      - `document` can be of `ParentNode`  
      - `document.querySelector(“.an-element”).querySelector()`  
    - `<Element>: ?`  
    - `Element|null` the return type  
  - **VSCode: Settings** => search for auto-save => `files.autoSaveWhenNoErrors`  
  - **VSCode:** [Pretty TypeScript Errors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors){:target="_blank"}  
  - Testing document/DOM-API in Vitest  
    - Initially when you use document.* in tests you’ll get “document is not defined” because vitest runs in Node.js environment where DOM is not a thing.  
    - One solution would be to:  
      - Install jsdom (or happy-dom): `npm install --save-dev jsdom`  
      - Put this comment in your tests:  

    ```js
    /**  
     * @vitest-environment jsdom  
     */  
    ```

    - Alternatives exist through the configuration files *(vite.config.json, vitest.config.json or vitest.config.ts???, ts.config.json, etc.)*  
      - Check the docs: [https://vitest.dev/config/\#environment](https://vitest.dev/config/#environment){:target="_blank"}  
  - Vitest: you can either skip certain tests or focus on individual tests by using the following methods on the it(), describe() and test() methods of vitest:  
    - `it.skip(...)`  
    - `it.only(...)`  
    - `describe.skip()` or `describe.only()`  
    - `test.skip()` or `test.only()`  
  - Be very careful with NaN checks, because **NaN === NaN will ALWAYS BE false**  
    - The safest way is through **Number.isNaN( value )**   
    - **CAUTION:** There is also a global **isNaN()**. **AVOID IT!**  
  - **utils.ts:10 Uncaught Error** means there’s an Error thrown somewhere and you are not explicitly handling it, e.g. try/catch, catch(), etc.  
  - For testing React Components we need to bring in **React Testing Library**  
    - [https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro){:target="_blank"}  
      - For TS: `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @types/react-dom @types/react`  
    - Great intro to RTL: [https://www.robinwieruch.de/vitest-react-testing-library/](https://www.robinwieruch.de/vitest-react-testing-library/){:target="_blank"}  
  - When installing npm packages (and if they do not already include TypeScript types) you can use the @types repo:  
    - `npm i sharp`  
    - `npm i -D @types/sharp`  
    - `npm install react`  
    - `npm install --save-dev @types/react`

### Summary

### Exercises

  - **Do you know the [`<picture>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture){:target="_blank"} elements?**  
    - Cropping or modifying images for different media (screen sizes) conditions  
    - Offering alternative image formats, for cases where certain formats are not supported.  
      - You can serve the highly compressed webp image type for browsers that support this format and provide an alternative fallback for older browsers that do no support webp  
  - Study open source projects (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and take a look at how they organize tests  
    - [**sharp**](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/tree/main/test/unit){:target="_blank"} *(a Node.js module for working with images on the server)*  
  - **Testing Library** (which includes React Testing Library): *“The @testing-library family of packages helps you **test UI components** in a user-centric way.”*  
  - Discover [**React Testing Library**](https://testing-library.com/){:target="_blank"}:  
    - The methods available for querying the DOM (grabbing HTML elements)  
    - The methods for testing whether these selected elements have a particular property, e.g. contain some text, etc.  
    - The methods for triggering actions, e.g. enter value in an input, click a button
