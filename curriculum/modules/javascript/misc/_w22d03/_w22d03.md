### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** DOM, VirtualDOM and State in React
  - **Part 2:** Rendering Components and useState

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week22/assets/day03/code){:target="_blank"}

  Lecture diagrams and animations are found [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week22/assets/day03/diagrams){:target="_blank"}

  **Lecture Notes & Questions:**

  - **Questions**  
    - Is the state setter async?  
      - Yes, it is, but in a React-async way. Not in a Promise way.  
        - Don’t do: **await setState().**  

  **References & Resources:**

  - **Hooks:**  
    - A set of functions that have the “use” prefix  
    - Hooks are used with Functional Components  
      - Hooks should NOT be called outside of a functional Component  
  - **State:**  
    - Stateless apps/components (no state)  
    - Stateful apps/components (some sort of state)  
    -   How to define a state in a React Component:  
      - 1) Import and call `useState( “someOptionalInitialValue” );`  
      - 2) Destructure the result of useState into **getter** and **setter**: `const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0);`  
    - Whenever the state setter updates the state, React reacts and renders the Component (calls the Component function again with the new state value)  
    - **React state values RETAIN their values across re-renders**  
    - **Normal variables DO NOT RETAIN their values across re-renders**  
  - **Events in React:**  
    - Event are only available on HTML elements  
      - 1) We pick an HTML element  
      - 2) We add an attribute in the form of *onEventName: onClick, onSubmit, onBlur, onChange, onInput, etc.*  
        - Note: In native DOM we use all lowercase: onclick, onsubmit, onblur attributes.
