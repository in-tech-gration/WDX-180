### Schedule

  - **Watch lectures on script loading strategies**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Two more lectures coming your way. Today's recorded lectures are all about `<script>` types and loading strategies and several other things you need to know when loading JavaScript files with your HTML code (e.g. `Cache busting` and more).

  - Watch our recorded live sessions:
    - [Part 1](https://youtu.be/-8-0kUHpo34){:target="_blank"} 
    - Part 2: _(Your lecturer will share the link with you)_

  **Lecture Notes:**

  - If the type of a `<script>` is something other than `"text/javascript"` the code will not execute: `<script type="text/ops">`
  - `Cache Busting`: just add `?something=here` after the filepath, eg. `<script src="app.js?version=2.3">`

  > **Cache:** Oxford Languages and Google defines it as follows:
  >
  > (noun) "A collection of items of the same type stored in a hidden or inaccessible place."
  >
  > (noun: computing) "An auxiliary memory from which high-speed retrieval is possible."
  >
  > (verb) "Store away in hiding or for future use."
  >
  > (verb: computing) "Store (data) in a cache memory."

  - Ways to clean the cache manually:
    - (A) Through the Browser settings
    - (B) Through the `DevTools: Command Palette > Clear Site Data`
    - (C) Browser Feature: Hard Reload/Refresh, Right click on Reload > Empty Cache and Reload

  - Visited links can be styled with CSS [`:visited`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:visited){:target="_blank"}

  - How to disable JavaScript in the Browser:
    - Open up [Command Palette](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/command-menu){:target="_blank"} => Disable JavaScript

  - Caution: The `<noscript>` tag can be abused by ad/tracking services!
