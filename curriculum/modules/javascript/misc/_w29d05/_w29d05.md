  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week29/assets/day05/code){:target="_blank"}

  **Lecture Notes:**

  **Lecture Questions:**

  - Should I combine Tailwind and Bootstrap?  
    - **Be very careful** and use it only as a **last resort** (my take: avoid)  
    - Try UI Kits like [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/){:target="_blank"}, Material UI, etc.  
      - Search for CSS UI Kits or Tailwind UI Kits or Bootstrap UI Kits  
    - Search for Tailwind-based Components (or sets of Components), or Tailwind-based Templates, etc.  
    - If you are using React, you can try CSS Modules or other CSS utilities.  
    - You can try and find how you can confine some CSS (e.g. a framework like Bootstrap) under a specific class.  
    - Do a research on native CSS “scoping”:

  **References & Resources:**

  - **Ways to avoid API keys and other sensitive information leaking to a public/private repo**  
    - Use a script or a library that checks for sensitive information before pushing  
    - Check your Version Control provider (BitBucket, GitLab, GitHub) for an option:

    - Use [environmental variables](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-an-environment-variable/){:target="_blank"} but be careful as there are types of env variables that have some code pushed  
    - Use **.gitignore** for preventing certain files or folders getting pushed  
    - Whenever you detect a leakage or a breach you should always revoke/cancel your keys and update your passwords.

    - Use a library ([https://immerjs.github.io/immer/](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/)){:target="_blank"}  
    - **Object.freeze()** (make sure to check the deep vs shallow freeze sections)
