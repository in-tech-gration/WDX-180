### Study Plan

  [Here's some code](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week30/assets/day02/code){:target="_blank"} to study and practice today.

  - Tasks:
    - Read and understand what the code does
    - Test the code (press the play button and switch to another Tab to see how the app behaves differently)
    - Does this remind you of chat applications (like Slack) that provide some notification when the chat Tab is out of focus?
    - Learn more about the Visibility Web API
    - Enforce `ts-check` and apply as many `JSDoc` types as you can
    - Improve the code and add comments
    - Share your version and questions!
    - **Have fun and enjoy!** :smiley:

  - Some [amazing tips](https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1790072655913050579){:target="_blank"} from Wes Bos for `<textarea>`'s. Completely mind-blowing CSS like `ex units`, `lh units` and more. Check it out!
