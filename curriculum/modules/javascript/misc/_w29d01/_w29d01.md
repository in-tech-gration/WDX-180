  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week29/assets/day01/code){:target="_blank"}

  **Study & Practice**

  - Think about a way to display the columns and rows (A, B, C... 1, 2, 3)  
    - Start by hardcoding the cols/rows, then implement a dynamic way that scales  
    - Consider both HTML and Canvas solutions and think about the pros and cons of each solution  
    - Try to leave the player canvas functionality and code out of it. The decorative code that displays the cols and rows should not affect the **main game** functionality.
