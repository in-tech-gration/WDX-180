### Study Plan

  First, go through the [Murdle tutorial](https://murdle.com/?mode=tutorial){:target="_blank"}. It's really fun and will help you understand the JavaScript tasks mentioned in the lecture.

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - Solving Click Event Mysteries (JavaScript) based on the [Murdle Mystery](https://murdle.com/){:target="_blank"} game.
  - Object Creators and their Toolset (and `this`)

  You can find the lecture code [here for part 1](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week16/assets/code/day05/part1-murlde-mystery/){:target="_blank"} and [here for part 2](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week16/assets/code/day05/part2-objects/){:target="_blank"}

  **Suggested material for study and practice:**
