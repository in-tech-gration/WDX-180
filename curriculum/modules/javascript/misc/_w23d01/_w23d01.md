title: "React Hooks: useState, useRef & useEffect"
---

### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** useState Hook
  - **Part 2:** useRef & useEffect Hooks

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week23/assets/day01/code){:target="_blank"}

  Remember, the code is a React app created using [vite](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project){:target="_blank"}.

  **Tips:**  
    - Temporarily disable ESLint: just at a comment at the top of the file: `/* eslint-disable */`

    - **A family of built-in functions in React that:**  
      - **are prefixed with “use”: useState, useRef, useEffect**  
      - **should ONLY be used inside Component functions**  
      - **should NOT be conditionally executed**  
  - **JavaScript:**  
    - **Highly recommended: [https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/README.md](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/README.md){:target="_blank"}**  
      - I don’t believe *“Async and Performance”* and *“ES6 and Beyond”* are relevant today as they are a bit outdated these days, so you can skip them.  
      - You can read the 2nd edition of “[Scopes & Closures](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/scope-closures/README.md){:target="_blank"}” since it’s ready and wait for the 2nd edition of *“Sync & Async”* and *“ES.Next & Beyond”*  
    - In order to master JS you should definitely master the following concepts:  
      - `this`  
      - anything asynchronous  
      - The object prototype

  - React Rule: useState creates a unique state value for each Component instance  
  - React Rule: Try to avoid mixing native DOM API and React  
    - We reach out to the Refs when there’s no other way of doing something with the DOM.  
    - We use useRef to make use of a vanilla JS library that needs direct access to the DOM (e.g. D3, Google Maps, etc.)  
  - State  
    - If you need a value that depends or is “derived” from a state variable, you probably don’t need another state variable for that. Just try with a simple local variable.  

### Summary

### Exercises

  - **Try to turn the App.jsx into a shopping cart**  
    - Idea: update shopping cart with number of items added   
    - Idea: Update the total price of the shopping cart  
  - **Study: [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect){:target="_blank"}**  
  - **Study:** Render & Commit: [https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit){:target="_blank"}
  - **Ideas:** refactor TrafficLight app using `useRef` and `useEffect`
