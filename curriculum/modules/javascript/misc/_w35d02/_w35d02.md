### Summary

### Exercises

  Yesterday, we returned some HTML from the web server (web.ts). This was just a simple template String literal. We can abstract this in a function for better re-usability.

  The web server checks the pathname using a basic if conditional and returns a custom HTML. By adding more paths, this code will become complicated and bloated. Maybe you can think of an abstraction so that the request pathname => appropriate HTML works better than the current implementation.

  Starting from [this code](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/build-a-cms-2024/tree/595a9d765bccd8418c7d20926f7730d4b70e7b64){:target="_blank"} on the CMS repository, (1) create a function that returns the HTML content based on the pathname and some dynamic values. (2) Create an abstraction over the server router: `pathname => load data => render HTML`
