### Summary

  The lecture covers the basics of building a web server using Node.js. The instructor demonstrates how to create a simple web server that responds to GET requests, checks for specific file types, and returns a 404 error if the requested file is not found.

  **Key Concepts:**

  * **Building a web server with Node.js**: The lecture shows how to create a basic web server using these technologies.
  * **Request handling**: The instructor explains how to check the request type (e.g., GET, POST) and respond accordingly.
  * **File system interaction**: The lecture demonstrates how to read files from the file system based on specific conditions.
  * **Error handling**: The instructor discusses the importance of proper error handling and shows how to return a 404 error when a requested file is not found.
	* Understanding routes and how to serve specific files based on URL requests
	* Creating a JSON API using Node.js
	* Serving data in JSON format
	* Exploring the concept of login mechanisms using Node.js
	* Creating a basic login system using JSON APIs

  **Key Points:**

  * **Return statements are crucial**: The instructor emphasizes that every path in an if statement should have a corresponding return statement or null value to avoid errors.
  * **Error handling is essential**: The lecture highlights the importance of proper error handling and shows how to handle errors like "Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client."
	* Understanding how JavaScript can be used on both the frontend (browser) and backend (server)
	* Exploring the possibilities of combining HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Node.js for creating dynamic web applications
