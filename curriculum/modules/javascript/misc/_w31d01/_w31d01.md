---

### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** TypeScript, Objects Constructors & Instances
  - **Part 2:** TypeScript, Objects Constructors & Instances

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week31/assets/day01/code){:target="_blank"} and the diagram [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/blob/main/curriculum/week31/assets/day01/20.05.2024-Object.Hierarchies.png){:target="_blank"}.

  - For private methods/properties we can use:  
    - the *private* keyword in TypeScript  
    - the `#` hash character in JavaScript  

  **Lecture Questions:**

  - Property `hasOwn` does not exist on type `ObjectConstructor`. Do you need to change your target library? Try changing the `lib` compiler option to `es2022` or later. `Object.hasOwn(pet,"run")` üò∞   
  -   `pet.hasOwnProperty("run")`  
    - [SO: Property 'assign' does not exist on type 'ObjectConstructor'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35959372/property-assign-does-not-exist-on-type-objectconstructor){:target="_blank"}  
  - Are static methods/properties the same as private methods/properties?  
    - No   
  - What is an *instance*?  
    - Any object created using the new keyword. The object is always **an instance of** the Class or Function Constructor that created it.

### Summary

### Exercises

  - **Study:** [instanceof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof){:target="_blank"}  
  - **Study:** [Sparse Arrays (vs Dense Arrays)](https://2ality.com/2012/06/dense-arrays.html)  
    - Also follow and read this blog and his books, articles and videos  
  - [Study private properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_properties)  
  - Investigate (more) on the difference between: **if ( obj.prop ) and if ( ‚Äúprop‚Äù in obj )**  
    - *‚ÄúA property may be present in an object but have value undefined. Therefore, x in obj is not the same as obj.x \!== undefined.‚Äù \~ The in operator @ [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in#description)*  
  - Try the following:  
    - Create a class (e.g. Cat, Fish) and/or constructor and then create instances of Cat and Fish (e.g. siameseCat) and try using the **object instanceof Cat** check.  
  - **Study:** [Array Constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array)
