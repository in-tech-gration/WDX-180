**Here are today's activities from the `Turing School of Software Engineering`:**

## ES6 Destructuring

[“Destructuring”](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) allows you to pull out data from arrays and objects into distinct variables with concise syntax.

**Round 1:** Given an object, in one line, assign variables to the values of the object using different names than the keys already in the object.

```js
var object = {name: 'elvis', title: 'hip swinger'}

// YOUR CODE HERE...

// console.log(person) => 'elvis'
// console.log(job) => 'hip swinger'
```

**Round 2:** What if I want to grab the values of the first and second elements of a given array using variables, and then swap the values of those variables?

```js
var items = ['apple', 'banana', 'pear']

// Currently, I would get the following returns:
console.log(a) => 'apple'
console.log(b) => 'banana'

// Assign variables using ES6 so that we get (note, you cannot just make a completely new array):
console.log(a) => 'banana';
console.log(b) => 'apple';
```

**Round 3:** Given an object, write one line of code that assigns variables to the keys.

```js
var object = {
  user: 'brenna',
  id: 1,
  date: 'monday',
  module: 3
}

// console.log(user) => ‘brenna’
```

**Round 4:** Given an object with nested objects, write one line of code that assigns variables to the keys.

```js
var object1 = {
  user: 'elvis',
  address: {
    city: 'denver',
    state: 'colorado'
  },
  id: 1
}
```

**Round 5:** Given an object, in one line of code pull out the individual keys to be accessible directly.

```js
var object = {name: 'elvis', title: 'hip swinger'}

// console.log(name) => 'elvis'
// console.log(title) => 'hip swinger'
```

**Round 6:** Given a crazy array of objects with nested objects, iterate over it and grab just the artist and the third album title.

```js
var singers = [
  {
    artist: 'Elvis',
    albums: {
      album1: 'this first title for Elvis',
      album2: 'another second title for Elvis',
      album3: 'third title for Elvis'
    }
  },
  {
    artist: 'Cher',
    albums: {
      album1: 'this first title for Cher',
      album2: 'another second title for Cher',
      album3: 'third title for Cher'
    }
  }
]

// 'Artist: Elvis, Third Album: third title for Elvis'
// 'Artist: Cher, Third Album: third title for Cher'
```

## Approaching Problems Many Ways

**Learning Goals**

- Develop a deeper understanding of iterator methods
- Reduce the risk of being too attached to one iterator method OR avoiding an iterator method
- Compare and contrast iterator methods by using different iterators to achieve the same output
- Practice using console logs effectively as part of your workflow
- Take note as scope issues arise

Given the following array, you will be solving the same challenge three times today. Each time, you will be told which iterator method(s) you’re allowed to use.

```js
const ninetiesToys = [
  {
      name: "Tamagotchi",
      releaseYear: 1996,
      price: 15.99
  },
  {
      name: "Furby",
      releaseYear: 1998,
      price: 29.99
  },
  {
      name: "Super Soaker",
      releaseYear: 1989,
      price: 19.99
  },
  {
      name: "Pogs",
      releaseYear: 1991,
      price: 5.99
  },
  {
      name: "Game Boy",
      releaseYear: 1989,
      price: 89.99
  }
];
```

**Round 1:** Write a function `findCheapToys` that uses `forEach` and returns an array of toy names that cost less than $20. You may not use any other iterator methods.

**Round 2:** Solve the prompt using a `filter` and `map`. You may not use any other iterator methods.

**Round 3:** Solve the prompt using a `reduce`. You may not use any other iterator methods.

**Plot Twist**

One by one, go back to each round’s solution and refactor it so that the `ninetiesToys` data set is passed as an argument when you invoke the function. This allows the same function to be used with multiple data sets.

Ensure it still works for your `ninetiesToys` data. Then, copy/paste the `eightiesToys` dataset below at the top of your file and invoke the refactored solution with the `eightiesToys` data passed as the argument. Ensure the function gives the correct result. Consider how this changed the steps of that solution.

```js
const eightiesToys = [
  {
    name: "Rubik's Cube",
    releaseYear: 1980,
    price: 9.99
  },
  {
    name: "Transformers",
    releaseYear: 1984,
    price: 19.99
  },
  {
    name: "My Little Pony",
    releaseYear: 1983,
    price: 12.99
  },
  {
    name: "Cabbage Patch Kids",
    releaseYear: 1982,
    price: 24.99
  },
  {
    name: "Nintendo Entertainment System",
    releaseYear: 1985,
    price: 89.99
  },
  {
    name: "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe",
    releaseYear: 1982,
    price: 14.99
  }
];
```
