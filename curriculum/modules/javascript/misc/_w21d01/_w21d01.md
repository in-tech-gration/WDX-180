  You can find the lecture code (created using `vite`) [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week21/assets/day01/code){:target="_blank"} and the lecture diagrams [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week21/assets/day01/diagrams){:target="_blank"}.

  **Lecture Notes & Questions:**

  - **ALWAYS** develop JS apps with the Browser console open  
  - Use the **.jsx** extension in files that use JSX. For plain JS files, you can stick with the **.js**  
  - How to include a folder inside a VSCode workspace from the CLI?  
    - `code -a some_folder/path`  
  - Avoid duplicate folders when creating a new React project using Vite: you **do not need to create a new folder manually** *(e.g. mkdir my-react-project)*. The npm create vite command will do this automatically.  

  **Questions:**  

  - *When should we use the self-closing syntax vs the open/closing tags with Components?*  
    - Use `<SelfClosing />` when no content is required  
    - Use `<OpenClose>`When content is between the tags`</OpenClose>`  
  - *Does **`<React.StrictMode>`** end up in production build when using Vite?*  
    - According to the [React docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode#enabling-strict-mode-for-entire-app){:target="_blank"}: *“All of these checks are development-only and do not impact the production build.”*  
  - *Can Vite optimize images automatically?*  
    - There seems to be a plugin available: [https://github.com/FatehAK/vite-plugin-image-optimizer](https://github.com/FatehAK/vite-plugin-image-optimizer){:target="_blank"}  
  - *What about WebVitals in Vite?*  
  - *What is the `<></>` syntax?*  
    - It’s called the [**React Fragment**](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment){:target="_blank"}  
  - *Can we turn a PWA into an Android app?*  
    - There seems to be an app created by Google called [BubbleWrap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJlbMfW3jPc){:target="_blank"}

  - How can you create a new React project?  
    - Using Vite: **npm create vite@latest**  
    - Using Create-React-App (CRA): **npx create-react-app my-app**  
    - Using Next.js (full-stack framework. Make sure that you need the extra baggage that comes with it)  
    - Using Gatsby (full-stack framework)  
    - Using Webpack (quite hard. Use it only if you want full and total control and configuration over the development process)  
  - Vite project structure:  
    - **node_modules/**: npm dependencies  
    - **public/**: static files  
    - **src/**: where all the application code lives  
    -   **assets/**: static assets and resources, e.g. images that will be imported dynamically (through *import()*)  
    - The src folder should be your main focus
