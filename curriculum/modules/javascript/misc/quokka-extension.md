**Quokka: an awesome learning tool and helping hand for VSCode**

Before moving forward, we have a recommendation for you. You can install and use a really nice VSCode extension that allows you to visualize the evaluation of each line of JavaScript code directly inside the code editor! 

- 1) Install the [Quokka.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode){:target="_blank"} Extension for VSCode

- 2) Watch this [12min video by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_sEWa5hA0Q){:target="_blank"} that explains how this extension works and shows some of the features for both the free and Pro versions.

- 3) Bookmark and check the [official documentation](https://quokkajs.com/docs/index.html){:target="_blank"}.
