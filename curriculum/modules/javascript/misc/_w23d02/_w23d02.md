### Study Plan

  In the last lecture, you were introduced to the `useState`, `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks.

  Today, we recommend that you study the following material to understand more about
  how these hooks work and how to avoid common beginner mistakes as well as taking
  a peek behind the algorithm that checks whether the `state` has changed in order 
  to re-render a Component.

  Grab a hot cup of coffee ☕️ (or tea), remove all distractions, and dive into the following
  resources:

  - [Preserving and Resetting State](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state){:target="_blank"}   
  - [All useEffect Mistakes Every Junior React Developer Makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQYeipc_cik){:target="_blank"}   
  - [Demystifying Object.is and prevState in React useState](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/react-object-is/){:target="_blank"}   

  Enjoy and don't forget to share your questions and comments.
