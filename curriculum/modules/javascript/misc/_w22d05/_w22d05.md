title: "Closures & React Routing"
---

### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** Video highlights (thanks to Aris Giotis ❤️):
    - Q&A: Dates, timezones, setTimeout & setInterval
    - Accessing previous and next State
    - Cycling through values and the Modulo % operator
    - Closures
    - Debugging
    - Tracking Component re-rendering

  - **Part 2:** Video highlights (thanks to Aris Giotis ❤️):
    - Closures and stale State
    - Routing, a high-level overview

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week22/assets/day05/code){:target="_blank"}

  **Lecture Notes & Questions:**

  - **Questions**  
    - **Is there a case where we need to clear an interval or timer?**  
      - Yes.(*we need to know about useEffect) When the Component that uses or displays the timer is removed from the page. Or when we want the interval to stop at some particular value.  
    - **How to (1) parse date (2) from an array with (3) objects in (4) React and use (5) Proptypes date requirement:**  
      - 1) Check the MDN docs for the `Date` object  
        - Converting a Date object to a string (toJSON())  
        - Converting a Date string back into an object  
        - How to work with Date objects and the `<input type=”date” value=”string”>`  
      - 2) Learn how to loop, iterate or access elements from an Array  
      - 3) Becoming familiar with manipulation objects  
      - 4) React is JS. Keep in mind the rules of React (render, re-render, state, normal variables vs state variables) and think how they interact with JS rules.  
      - 5) Check the prop-types docs for the proper type. Is there a Date type, PropTypes.date.required?  
    - How to use `setInterval` and `setTimeout` in React*  
      - Things to remember about `window.setInterval` and `window.setTimeout` are:  
        - Async (but **NOT promises**)  
          - `await setTimeout()` <= NO NO NO  
          - Idea: try to turn them into promise-based functions  
        - There are counterparts that clear both of them: *clearInterval* and *clearTimeout*  
        - React complicates matters through the re-rendering  
    - How to cycle through (roughly loop over, go through, iterate **again and again**) values without an use of an array  
      - **Learn more about the % modulo operator and how it can be used in “cycles”**  
      - A switch statement  
      - An object  
      - A single variable that conditionally gets assigned different values  
      - Iterables*  
    - [**React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component**](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#setstate-parameters){:target="_blank"}  

  - **Tips**  
    - **If you want different instances of a Component to share the same state, you will have to move the state to a parent Component**  

  **References & Resources:**

  > "You can pass the next state directly, or a function that calculates it from the previous state: setAge(a => a + 1);"

  ~ [Source](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#setstate-caveats){:target="_blank"}


  - **State rule #1: (!!!)**  
    - **NEVER directly update or modify the state variables:**  
      - **const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0);**  
      - **NEVER EVER: counter = counter + 1, counter++**   
  - **Render:**  
    - **Rule:** When the state of a Component changes, React will trigger a re-render (executed the Component function again)  
    - **Subrule:** All the child Components of the parent Component will re-render also (by default)  
    - Note: rendering does NOT imply Real DOM repainting!  
  - **Closures**  
    - When you calculate 43*5, you store 43 and 5, process, respond (return) 215 and then your brain “garbage collects” aka discards the 43 and  5 values.
