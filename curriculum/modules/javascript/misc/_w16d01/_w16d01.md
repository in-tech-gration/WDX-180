title: "Event Handling & Propagation"
---

### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** Event Handling and managing multiple listeners
  - **Part 2:** Understanding `stopPropagation()`, `preventDefault()` and the difference between `event.target` and `event.currentTarget`

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/blob/main/curriculum/week16/assets/code/day01/index.html){:target="_blank"}

  **Lecture Notes:**

  - The **2nd argument** to addEventListener( type, **FUNCTION** ) is often referred to as a **callback function** and/or an **event handler**.  
    - 1) Keep a note of these terms. 
    - 2) Explain or describe what these terms mean in your own words. 
    - 3) You should be able to answer the question “What is a callback function?” and/or “What is an event handler?” in a technical interview.  
  - Real-life use case of `useCapture`?  
    - [GitHub search](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/fb8eddd5a9f6d92b68a74f44bda61207b574291d/web/libs/editor/src/tools/MagicWand.js#L262){:target="_blank"} (real-life example search with great comments)  

  **Suggested material for study & practice:**

  - [mouseenter/leave + mouseover/out](https://javascript.info/mousemove-mouseover-mouseout-mouseenter-mouseleave){:target="_blank"}   
  - Discover events: `touchstartstart`, `touchend`, `touchmove` and other.  
  - Learn how to use the VSCode *Rename Symbol* feature.  
  - Understand the difference between [stopPropagation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation){:target="_blank"} and [stopImmediatePropagation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopImmediatePropagation){:target="_blank"} 

  **References & Resources:**

  - **Best Practices**: **prefer const** with object values  
  - **Best Practices**: XRAY Rule. Don’t pass expressions as arguments to functions, e.g. `someFunction( 5 * 45 / 4 );` Store the argument value in a variable, display (xray) the variable and pass the variable to the function: `const val = 5 * 45 / 4; console.log(val); someFunction(val);`  
  - [Events Reference (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events){:target="_blank"}  
  - `event.preventDefault()`: in the case of an `<a\>` tag, it prevents the redirection.  
    - The default behaviour that will be prevented differs from element to element and from event to event.  
  - If you have the same event listener on the same element (yes, you can do that), the order is based on the actual source code declaration of the listeners.   
  - [addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#return_value){:target="_blank"} **always** returns undefined
