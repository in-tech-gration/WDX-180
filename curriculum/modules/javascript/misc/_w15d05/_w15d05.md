### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - Part 1: Events & target vs currentTarget
  - Part 2: Events & Stopping Propagation, Creating a Modal

  - Learn about [removeEventListener()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener){:target="_blank"}  

  - HTMLElement.**className [(MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className){:target="_blank"} (Read/Write)**  
    - **document.querySelector(“h1”).className \=== \<h1 class=”THIS VALUE HERE”\>**  
  - HTMLElement.**nodeName [(MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/nodeName){:target="_blank"} (Read-only)**  
    - **nodeName,** gives you the tag name in UPPERCASE e.g. **HEADER \=== \<header\>, H1 \=== \<h1\>, BUTTON \=== \<button\>, DIV \=== \<div\>**  
  - **event.target is ALWAYS the element that triggered the event**, e.g. the button or any element that was clicked.  
  - **event.stopPropagation() [(MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation){:target="_blank"}:** stops the event flow (propagation) from moving forward. Can happen from within an Event Listener at any step (capturing, bubbling).
  - **event.currentTarget is the element that has the eventListener added to it.**  

  ```js
  CURRENTTARGET.addEventListener( event, function(event){  
    event.currentTarget === CURRENTTARGET  
  })  
  ```

  **Code**

  - The [Accept Cookies Modal example](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/modules/javascript/misc/_w15d05/assets/code/cookies-modal){:target="_blank"}
