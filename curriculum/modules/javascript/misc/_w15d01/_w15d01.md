### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** Check your Frontend knowledge / Learn about the `arguments` object
  - **Part 2:** ECMAScript 6 Modules (`import/export`)

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week15/assets/code){:target="_blank"}

  **Suggested material for study:**

  - The Function [Arguments Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments){:target="_blank"}
  - [Rest Parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters){:target="_blank"}
  -[Default Parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters){:target="_blank"}

### Summary

  In the first lecture, we try to answer some of the following questions and check whether we are up-to-date with some important Frontend concepts:

  - What is Browser-Caching?
  - What is Cache Busting?  
  - What is Server-Caching?
  - What is rendering?
  - What are Backend languages?
  - What is dynamic content?
  - What are the steps of `<script>` parsing in the Browser?
  - What is defer/async?

  Next, the first lecture explores the `arguments` object that is used inside function definitions to access all the arguments passed to the function, even if they are not declared as parameters.

  In the second lecture we explore JavaScript modules and imports:

  1. Basic import and export statements
  2. Using the `import` statement with curly braces (`{}`)
  3. Dynamic imports using the `import()` function
  4. Using `async/await` with dynamic imports
  5. Handling errors and rejections when importing modules

  The lecture also covers examples of how to use dynamic imports to preload modules, such as importing a module when the mouse cursor is close 
  to an element on the screen.

### Exercises

  - Complete the [MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules){:target="_blank"} on Modules and share your code and questions on Slack  
  - Try to implement modules on your personal/group project(s)  
  - Try to implement dynamic module loading when the mouse cursor is close to the button about to be clicked (you can try the mouseenter, mousemove events)

### Extra Resources

  - Read [Good Code, is a love letter to the next developer who will maintain it](https://addyosmani.com/blog/good-code/){:target="_blank"} by Addy Osmani
