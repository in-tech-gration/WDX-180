### Study Plan

  ![](./assets/Knock.Knock.png)

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. The first part of the lecture is about Promises and error handling, while the second part is all about `scope` in JavaScript and different ways to define variables.  

  > A new term needs a proper Google search for its original definition:
  > 
  > **Scope:** *“the extent of the area or subject matter that something deals with or to which it is relevant.”*  
  > *Example: "we widened the scope of our investigation"*  

  - **Recommended reading:** read the full articles about [var](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var){:target="_blank"}, [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let){:target="_blank"} and [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const){:target="_blank"} on MDN and share your questions on our Slack forum or leave a comment below.

### Summary

  Here is an AI-generated summary of the lectures:

  **Lecture 1: Promises**

  1. **Creating promises**: The instructor explains how to create promises using the `Promise` constructor and provides examples.

  2. **Handling promise errors**: He demonstrates how to handle promise errors using `.catch()` or `.finally()`.

  3. **Chaining promises**: The discussion covers chaining promises together using the `.then()` method.

  4. **Combining promises**: The instructor shows how to combine multiple promises into a single promise using methods like `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`.

  5. **Performance measurement**: He mentions the importance of measuring performance in JavaScript and provides a link to an MDN API for timing functions.

  6. **Timing promise execution**: The discussion highlights that there's no way to guarantee the exact time it takes for promises to execute, even on the same machine.

  The meeting also touches upon related topics, such as:

  * Creating arrow functions with single statements
  * Combining multiple promise-based functions into a single function

  **Lecture 2: Scope**

  1. The concept of scope in JavaScript is important to understand.

  2. There are different types of scope: global, function, and block scope.

  3. Variables declared with `var` have function scope, while variables declared with `let` or `const` have block scope.

  4. Lexical scoping (also known as static scoping) is a way of resolving variable references in JavaScript.

  5. It's not necessary to know the term "lexical scoping" to understand how scope works in JavaScript; just learn the rules and you'll be fine.

  6. Naming variables can help with understanding scope, especially when working with complex code.

### Exercises

  - Practice with Promises and what you've learned from the lectures

  - Study the behavior of the following code, and make sure to understand the mechanics behind it and be able to explain this during a coding interview (practice by explaining this to an imaginary person or to a class mate):

  ```js
  console.log(a);
  var a = 42;
  console.log(a);

  console.log(b);
  let b = 42;
  console.log(b);
  ```
