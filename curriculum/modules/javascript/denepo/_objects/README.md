# Objects

Move over to the examples folder and try out as many as you can! Below are
listed the goals of following this material.

<!-- Content taken from https://github.com/in-tech-gration/inside-js/blob/main/README.md#9-Multiple-Interactions -->
- **Skills**:
  - [ ] 🥚 **Avoiding Side Effects**: You can read, debug and write functions
        that use objects as arguments, _without_ creating side-effects.
  - 🐣 **_Stateful_ Programs**: You can step through, debug and complete
    programs with an HTML/CSS interface that store user data in an object
    between interactions.
- **Language Features**:
  - [ ] 🥚 **Object Literals**: You can declare a new object with initial
        key/value pairs using _object literal_ syntax:
        `const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };`.
  - [ ] 🐣 **Dots vs. Brackets**: You can explain the difference between _dot_
        and _bracket_ access in an object and can decide which one is best in
        your code.
  - [ ] 🐣 **Reference vs. Values**: You can show that objects are stored by
        reference with an example that modifies one object from two variables.
