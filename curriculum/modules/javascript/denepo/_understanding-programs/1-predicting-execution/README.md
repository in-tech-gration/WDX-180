# Predicting Execution

Studying JavaScript will be challenging. Our way of learning is not
glamorous. You will need to learn how to study JS, and very importantly

- you will need to adjust your learning expectations

Studying JavaScript will be 100% different from learning HTML and CSS. HTML &
CSS are all about learning and applying rules. if you apply the rules correctly,
your web page looks right. You don't need to think about what happens between
your code and the final web page

- Studying JavaScript is 100% about what happens behind the scenes

Programming is all about inner processes. You should focus 100% on what happens
between starting your script and the final result. Making your code work, or
solving a challenge is second. Learning how the JavaScript engine executes your
code step-by-step is first. You should focus on ...

## Program Memory

_Program Memory_ is a term that refers to the values stored in memory at EACH
SPECIFIC moment of execution. These values can change often, sometimes at every
step of your program! Learning to program requires you to understand:

- how does the JS engine represent memory?
- how does the JS engine interpret your code line-by-line?
- how does each instruction interact with program memory?

Your first goal is learning to see what is happening inside your program at each
step:

- **DevTools Debugger**: The best way to peek inside program memory. It will
  take some practice to use effectively and is worth every second. You can see
  every value in memory, at every step of your program's execution. Debuggers
  are designed to help you understand how memory is structured in JS. Here is a
