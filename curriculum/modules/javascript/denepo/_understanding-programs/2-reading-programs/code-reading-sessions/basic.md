# Basic Code Reading Session

You will need:

- a timer

  -and-

- a printed copy of the code for the club and coloured pens, crayons or pencils

  -or-

- an electronic means of scribbling on code (e.g. a tablet and tablet pen, PDF
  annotation software, study-lenses)

## First glance

The goal of this exercise is to practice to get a first impression of code and
to act upon that. We all have different instincts and strategies for where to
start when faced with a new piece of code. It doesn't matter how trivial you
think the first and second things you noticed are.

## (1 min) Independently - Glance at the code

It's important that is an immediate reaction.

- Right away, note down the first thing that catches your eye.
- Then note down the second thing that catches your eye.
- Take the remainder of the minute to think about why you noticed those things
  first.

## (5 mins) Together - Discuss the results

Talk about why things might have jumped out for different people. It might be
tempting for some people to start talking about the big picture; try to steer
discussion back to individual details, rather than summaries.

- How do those initial observations help with deciding what to look at next?
- What lines or facts or concepts were chosen by everyone versus by only a few
  people?

Reflect also on what kind of knowledge you used in this exercise:

- Knowledge of the domain, of the programming language?
- What knowledge do you think might be needed to better understand this code?

## Code structure

The goal of this exercise is to be a concrete thing to _do_ when looking at new
code for the first time. New code can be scary, doing something will help!
Digital annotation can take a bit longer than on paper. Leave time for your
group members to settle on a technique that works for them.

## (10 mins) Independently - Examine structure

Variables

- Go through the code and circle all variables in red
- Then draw a link between variables and their uses

Interactions

- Go through the code and circle all user interactions
- Then draw a link between interactions and the variables they are associated
  with

Control Flow

- Go through the code and circle all control flow in blue
- Then draw a link between control flow tests and the variables tested

## (10 mins) Together - Discuss the results

- Did anyone have trouble deciding what constituted a variable, interaction or
  control flow?
- What patterns are visible from the colors and links only?
- How does the data flow through the code?
- What parts of the code seem to warrant more attention?

## Content

The goal of these exercises is to start to think about which lines in the code
define its essence, have the biggest impact or need to be paid close attention
to.

## Option 1

Start by examining the names of things. This is one method for discovering how
the code fits together and its intentions. It can help make the identifying
important lines exercises less intimidating.

### All variable names (5 mins)

As a group, go through the code mechanically and create a list of all identifier
names in the snippet. This can be done with one person scribing while others
call out. If you have done the "examine structure" exercise before, this should
be relatively quick and easy; but sometimes, you will need short discussions to
agree on things.

### Discussion 1 (10 mins)

- What can we learn from these names?
- Which elements are related to each other, from the names only?
- Are there names that are ambiguous when looked at without context?

## Option 2

### A random line (5 mins)

> if you are using the `?highlight` lens to study your code, there is a [random
>
> > line] button you can use for this step.

Select a random line from the code in whatever way you like. It can be helpful
to randomly pick 3 line numbers and have the facilitator choose from them, which
they think will be most interesting to talk about; but surprisingly, even a
blank line can generate some conversation!

Examine this line individually. What is the main idea of this line? What lines
does it relate to and why?

### Discussion 2 (10 mins)

Discuss in the group:

- What is the 'scope' of the random line? What part of the code was seen as
  related?
- How does the line fit into the rest of the code base?

## (8 mins) Independently - Identify most important lines

Briefly discuss what it means to be important as a group (if you want to)

- then, identify the 5 lines you consider most important

## (10 mins) Together 1 - Discuss

Discuss in the group:

- lines covered by many people?
- lines named but not by a lot of people
- Agree on less than 8 of the most important lines

Take turns in the group, and let every member talk about the code for 30 seconds
(or less/more, could also be one sentence each). Try to add new information and
not repeat things that have been said, and repeat until people do not know new
things anymore.

## Summary

The goal of this exercise is to think about the core purpose or use of this
code.

## (5 mins) Independently - Summarize

- try to write down the essence of the code in a few sentences

## (10 mins) Together 2 - Discuss

- topics covered by many vs few
- strategies used to create the summary (e.g. variable names, documentation,
  prior knowledge, )

## Independently - homework?

- Compare the summary with the available documentation (inside and outside the
  code)
- Identify differences and similarities between the group's findings and the
  existing
