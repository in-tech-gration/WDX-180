# Advanced Code Reading Session

These exercises are more advanced, in the sense that you might need a bit more
understanding of the code for these to make sense. This might be because the
group is familiar with the code before the session, or because you are doing a
second club on the same code snippet. In our experience, the first code club on
one code snippet is mainly understanding what the code does, a second session
typically goes deeper and sheds more light on the patterns in the code.

## Code structure

## Examine structure (5 mins)

This first exercise is meant as a recap of the first session on the code, and as
a way to onboard people that might have missed the first session on this code
snippet.

Go back to your markings of the code where you examined the structure of the
code (such as circle variables and link them), or reuse the notes from the
previous club. Individually study the patterns and think about what they tell
you. What direction does the code 'flow' in? What parts stand out for lack of,
or access of links?

## Discussion 1 (10 mins)

- Parts of the code covered by many vs few
- Strategies used to decide

## Content

## Central thematic concepts (5 mins)

Each participant gets 5 minutes to individually name the 5 most central concepts
of the code. These could be names, themes, language features, or information
found in comments. It is important to note that there are no right or wrong
answers here! We are not looking for the correct 5 concepts, we are together
trying to practice reading code and gain insights into how each other people
approach and understand reading code. We have found that one of the most
important things people gain from the reading club is realising that people do
not all comprehend and create code in the same way.

## Discussion 2 (10 mins)

- Topics covered by many vs few
- Strategies used to decide (e.g. variable names, comments, documentation, prior
  knowledge of the program)

## Central programming concepts (5 mins)

Each participant gets 5 minutes to individually name the 5 most central
programming concepts of the code. These could be algorithms, data structures,
assumptions or techniques. Again here, no right and wrong! These questions are
conversation starters.

## Discussion 3 (10 mins)

- Topics covered by many vs few
- Strategies used to decide (e.g. variable names, comments, documentation, prior
  knowledge of the program)

## The decisions made in the code (5 mins)

Each participant gets 5 minutes to individually understand the decisions that
were visible in the code. Reexamine the code snippet and list decisions of the
creator(s) of the code, for example a decision to use a certain design pattern
or use a certain language feature or operator.

You might want to think about these questions:

- What decisions were made in the creation of this code?

## Discussion 4 (10 mins)

- Decisions covered by many vs few
- Strategies used to decide (e.g. variable names, comments, documentation, prior
  knowledge of the program)

## Consequences of the decisions (5 mins)

Each participant gets 5 minutes to individually understand the consequences of
the decisions that were made. These could be the decisions you found yourself in
the previous exercise or a decision someone else pointed out.

You might want to think consider the impact of the decisions this code on:

- readability
- user experience
- strategy

## Discussion 5 (10 mins)

- Consequences covered by many vs few
- Pros of these decisions
- Possible cons of these decisions

## The 'why' of the decisions (5 mins)

Each participant gets 5 minutes to individually understand the 'why' of the
decisions that were made. Can you understand why the code was designed this way?

- What assumptions do these decisions rely on?
- Can you understand why these decisions were made?
- What alternatives would have been possible?

## Discussion (10 mins)

- Assumptions/alternatives covered by many vs few
- Alternative solutions
