# Code Reading Sessions

This folder contains a set of exercises which can be used in Code Reading Clubs.
Of course, your club does not need to use all exercises, they are meant as a
starting point. If you are trying out variants, do let us know! For now we have
divided them into [basic](./basic.md?--defaults) and [advanced](./advanced.md?--defaults). [Advanced exercises](./advanced.md?--defaults) can be used in clubs
that have been running for a while, and especially work well when doing a second
code club using the same code snippet.

**Tools and Resources**

- [Annotation Tool](https://annotate.codereading.club/#/)
  - Use the annotation tool to import files from GitHub and hightlight parts of the code. Hightlighted areas can be linked with arrows to make connections, and individual lines of code can be marked.

- [PDF Maker](https://pdf.codereading.club/)
  - Convert code from GitHub to PDFs for printing, ready to use in in-person code reading sessions.
