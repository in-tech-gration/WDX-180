# [Plain Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) Programs

Code without colors that you can't run. For some practice reading programs
differently than you're used to. After all, code is just text! Colors are
helpful but not actually part of JavaScript.

- How do you read this code differently from the colorized programs in other
  folders?
- Is it easier or harder to find what's more important?
- How do you study the program differently when you can't run it? (When you can
  only study it _statically_)
