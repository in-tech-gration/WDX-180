### Study Plan

  Another essential concept in coding is functions, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times. In this module we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and parameters.

  In JavaScript, you'll find functions everywhere. In fact, we've been using functions all the way through the course so far; we've just not been talking about them very much. Now is the time, however, for us to start talking about functions explicitly, and really exploring their syntax.

  Pretty much anytime you make use of a JavaScript structure that features a pair of parentheses — () — and you're not using a common built-in language structure like a for loop, while or do...while loop, or if...else statement, you are making use of a function.

  > The examples and exercises in this repository all use () => {} (arrow functions), while many resources online cover function functions. Why? Because arrow functions are simpler to study in the debugger. That's all you need to know for now!

  Make sure to follow the guides on **Setting up Study Lenses (v2) on your System**. Once `lenses2` is properly installed on your system, you can go to your `WDX-180` folder and run `lenses2` with the material for this Module:

  - `cd WDX-180/`
  - `lenses2 curriculum/modules/javascript/denepo/_inside-js/3-functions/`

  You should focus and study the following modules (included within `3-functions/`):

  - **1-functions**
  - **2-documenting-functions**
  - **3-the-callstack**
  - **4-local-param-parent**
