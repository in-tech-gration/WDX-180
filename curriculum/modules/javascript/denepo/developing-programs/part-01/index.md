### Study Plan

  This Module is about "Developing Programs". Now it's finally time to put those skills into action! Hop on the material provided and you'll soon be able to start writing programs from a blank page!

  In order to follow the material, you will need to install and use the `study-lenses` tool. [Here are the instructions](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/curriculum/modules/javascript/denepo/setting-up-study-lenses/){:target="_blank"} in case you've missed them.

  **Launching Study Lenses and following the material**

  Once `lenses2` is properly installed on your system, you can go to your `WDX-180` folder and run `lenses2` with the material for this Module:

  - `cd WDX-180/`
  - `lenses2 curriculum/modules/javascript/denepo/_developing-programs/`

  or just:

  - `cd WDX-180/curriculum/modules/javascript/denepo/_developing-programs/`
  - `lenses2`

  Now it's time to go through the material. For this Module you will only need to go through the following sections:

  - **0-pair-programming**
  - **1-linting**
  - **2-fixing-errors**
