# Refactoring Logic

These programs work already, but do not use any `/utils`. Your task is to
refactor logic from the program and into the `/utils` functions. It might help
to follow these steps:

1. Study the working program, find the part your are supposed to refactor, and
   find which function you are supposed to use.
2. Write the function you are supposed to use with the program's logic as a
   starting point. Make sure all the tests pass!
3. Replace the entire commented part of the program with call(s) to your new
   function.
4. Make sure your program still works like it did before.
