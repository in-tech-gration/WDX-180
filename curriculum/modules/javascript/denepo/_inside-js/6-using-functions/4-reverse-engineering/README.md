# Reverse-Engineering

You'll be given a working program that you cannot read. Your task is to:

1. Use the unreadable program so you understand what it's supposed to do.
2. Write a new program that does the same thing, in one file! Don't worry about
   functions yet.
3. Study your program and decide which part(s) can be refactored into separate
   function(s).
4. Write tests and function(s) for your program's logic. Make sure all the tests
   pass before moving on.
5. Modify your original program so it uses your function instead of having all
   of the logic in one file.

## Re-Using Functions

If you think you can use the same `/utils` function in more than one program, go
for it! It's always a good idea to write a function once and reuse it as many
times as possible.
