# Comments and Logs

Comments and logs are for developers, not for the computer. They exist to help
you understand your program.

Comments and logging will not change what your program does, just how easy it is
to understand.

## ðŸ¥š Comments

```js
'use strict';
// comments are for people to read, not computers
// these are both one-line comments

// if you run or trace this snippet, nothing will happen
```

```js
'use strict';
/* this is a block comment

  block comments are useful for writing longer messages

  - and for
  - things like
  - lists

  if you run or trace this snippet nothing will happen
*/
```

## ðŸ¥š Logging

```js
'use strict';
// print a message to the browser's console
console.log('-- logging --');

// an empty log
console.log();

// you can log more than one thing at a time
console.log('a', 'message', 'from', 'beyond'); // 'a', 'message', 'from', 'beyond'
```
