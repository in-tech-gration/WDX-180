# Value Swaps

> [Guide video](https://vimeo.com/713210298)

These exercises are not supposed to show you good practice. When writing your
own code you will want to avoid ever changing the value of a variable once it
has been assigned.

The goal of learning the value swaps is to understand how JS memory changes over
time, and how each line of code executes line by line to modify memory.
