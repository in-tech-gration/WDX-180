# If/Else

How do you write a single conditional in JavaScript?

<details>
<summary><strong>A: </strong> <code>if {aCondition} ( ) else ( ) </code></summary>
<br>

✖ Nope.

In this code the curly braces `{ }` and parenthesis `( )` are switched.

The parenthesis are supposed to be around the condition, and the curly braces
are supposed to be around the bodies.

<summary><strong>B: </strong> <code>if aCondition: ... else: ... </code></summary>
<br>

✖ Nope.

In JavaScript, the body of an `if` and an `else` Are marked by curly braces
`{ }`. Some programming languages use a colon `:`, but not JS.

The condition must also be surrounded by parenthesis: `(aCondition)`
