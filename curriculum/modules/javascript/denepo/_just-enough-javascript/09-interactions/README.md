# User Interactions

Logging is for developers, Interactions are for Users. JavaScript in the browser
has 3 ways to do basic user interactions. They don't create the best user
experience but they are practical for learning to program.

Learning to use these 3 functions will help you to understand primitive types
and values. Each interaction is a _function_ (you'll learn more about functions
in Debugging). Functions _return_ a value, meaning that you can use them to
assign a value to a variable. But each interaction returns a _different_ type.

Adding interactions into your programs will make them more interesting to study.
You can't know exactly what values a user will input, so your programs have to
deal with some uncertainty!

Trace this example and see each type of interaction in action:

```js
'use strict';
console.log('-- user interactions --');

let alertValue = alert('this is an alert');
console.log(alertValue); // undefined

let confirmValue = confirm('this is a confirm');
console.log(confirmValue); // true or false

let promptValue = prompt('this is a prompt');
console.log(promptValue); // a string or null
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¥š alert</summary>

```js
'use strict';
console.log('-- alert --');
// alert: displays a message to the user
//  the user can only read the message, they can't input anything to your program
let alerted = alert('pancakes');

// alert will always return undefined, no matter what
console.log(alerted); // undefined
console.log(typeof alerted); // 'undefined'
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¥š confirm</summary>

```js
'use strict';
console.log('-- confirm --');
// confirm: display a message and ask the user to say "yes" or "no"

// run this example a few times with your console open. what happens if you:
//  click "ok"?
//  click "cancel"?
//  press the "enter" key on your keyboard?
//  pres the "esc" key on your keyboard?
let confirmed = confirm('want some pancakes?');

// confirm will always return a boolean value:
//  true if the user clicks ok
//  false if the user clicks cancel
console.log(confirmed); // true or false
console.log(typeof confirmed); // 'boolean'
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>ðŸ¥š prompt</summary>

```js
'use strict';
console.log('-- prompt --');

// prompt: display a message and allow the user to input some text

// run this example a few times in the console. what happens if you:
//  type something -> click "cancel" or press the "esc" key
//  type something -> click "ok" or press the "enter" key
//  do not type anything -> click "cancel" or press the "esc" key
//  do not type anything -> click "ok" or press the "enter" key
let prompted = prompt('what is your favorite kind of pancake');

// prompt will either return a string or null
//  null: if the user clicks "cancel" or presses the "esc" key
//  string: if the user clicks "ok" or uses the "enter" key
//    it doesn't matter if the user types anything or not!
//    if they type nothing, prompt returns an empty string
console.log(prompted); // the user's text or null
console.log(typeof prompted); // 'string' or 'object'
```

## Tracing User Interactions

Tracing code with user interactions is more challenging than tracing code with
no interactions. In programs with user interactions it's impossible to know what
values will be in your program until you run it!

This means you must think about all the different things a user could do. To
fully understand an interactive program you will need to trace it many times,
each time with different imagined values from the user.

## A Small Program

Here's a small program that uses `prompt`, `alert` and `confirm`. You'll learn
how it all works in the coming chapters.

<details>
<summary>check it out</summary>

```js
'use strict';
console.log('-- user interactions --');

let input = null;
while (input === null) {
  input = prompt('enter something');
}

let didConfirm = confirm('is this correct?\n\n "' + input + '"');
if (didConfirm) {
  alert('yes!');
} else {
  alert('no :(');
}
```
