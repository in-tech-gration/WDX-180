# DOM I/O

These exercises do not use `prompt`/`alert`/`confirm`, instead they use the DOM
I/O library. There are examples in this folder that can help you figure it out,
and you can also check [the documentation](../../../lib/dom-io/DOCS.md) for more
information.

You can solve these exercises using only JS language features you've studied so
far in Just Enough JavaScript
