# Explorations

Anything goes in here. Your folder to practice writing and experimenting with
JavaScript.

- curious about a specific language feature? write a file with some experiments
- have an idea for a program? try writing it here

---

## PS

You will need to create new exploration files using Visual Studio Code or the
CLI, then you can open them to study in Study Lenses. It's not possible to
create new files from the browser using Study Lenses.
