# Marking Syntax

The marking exercises in this chapter will have 3 syntax features you need to
study:

1. **Primitives**: A small arrow _under_ the primitive.
1. **Identifiers**: A line _under_ the identifier.
1. **Function Calls**: A line under the identifier and a half-box under the
   arguments.
