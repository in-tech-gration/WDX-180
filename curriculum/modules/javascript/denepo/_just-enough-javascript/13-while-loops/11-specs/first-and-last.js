/*
  a user can provide input that starts with a capital letter and ends with a period
    - given the user cancels, they will be prompted again
    - given the input is shorter than two characters, they will be prompted again
    - given their input does not begin with a capital letter, they will be prompted again
    - given their input does not end with a period, they will be prompted again
    - given their input is valid, the first letter will be lower-cased and the period removed
    - given their input is valid, the loop will exit

  test cases:
    invalid input:
      (no test cases! the loop will not exit so there will be no output to test)
    two-character input:
      'A.' -> 'a'
      'X.' -> 'x'
    longer words:
      'Hello.' -> 'hello'
      'JavaScript!.' -> 'javaScript!'
    with some spaces:
      'Hello World.' -> 'hello World'
      'Hack your future.' -> 'hack your future'

  checklist:
    [ ] the code is formatted

      - use full sentences and correct JS vocabulary
    [ ] the program runs
    [ ] the program has no errors
    [ ] all of the test cases work
    [ ] you tested strange inputs that could break your program (edge cases)
