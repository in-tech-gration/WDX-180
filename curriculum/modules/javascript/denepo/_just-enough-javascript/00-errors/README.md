# Errors

Errors are unavoidable in programming. In Welcome to JS most of the exercises
ask you to study programs that work so you shouldn't face tooo many errors. When
you do get an error, don't let this get you down. It's easier to write code that
_has_ errors than to write code that _doesn't_!

Understanding and fixing errors in your code will take lots of practice, in the
next module you will study errors in depth. For now all you need to know about
errors is:

- the error _name_ and _message_ so you can search about it online. You don't
  need to understand everything you read about the error, but you should be able
  to find links about it.
- finding the line where the error occurred by reading the error log and
  clicking on the line number .
- `ctr-z`, so you can undo your error and try again.

As you complete each exercise you should keep track of all the errors you
encountered. Try thinking of errors as the computer's best attempt at helping
you fix your mistakes. Take notes on which errors you make the most often and
what you figure out to avoid them.

## Run Early and Often

Another strategy for dealing with errors is to run your code early and often:
after every single tiny change try running the program. This helps you figure
out what went wrong because the error must be related to the tiny change you
just made.

## ReferenceError: \_ is not defined

There is one error you do not need to keep track of in your notes -
`ReferenceError: _ is not defined`. You will get this error all the time, and
it's not because of the code you write. we use \_ to show you where something is
missing in the program, but JavaScript reads \_ as a variable that has not been
declared.

Instead of dreading this error, you can thank it for telling you where the next
blank is!
