/* Challenge: write this program using at least 1 `break`

  a user can provide input that contains only uppercase and lowercase letters
    - given the user cancels, they will be prompted again
    - given the input is empty, they will be prompted again
    - given their input contains anything that is not a letter, they will be prompted again
    - given their input is valid, the loop will exit and their input is alerted

  test cases:
    invalid input:
      (no test cases! the loop will not exit so there will be no output to test)
    input with only letters:
      'abcdABCD' -> 'abcdABCD'
      'JAVAscript' -> 'JAVAscript'
      'hi' -> 'hi'

/*
  checklist:
    [ ] the code is formatted
    [ ] linting check passes
    [ ] variable names are clear and helpful
    [ ] each line of code is explained in a comment above that line
      - use full sentences and correct JS vocabulary
    [ ] the program runs
    [ ] the program has no errors
    [ ] all of the test cases work
    [ ] you tested strange inputs that could break your program (edge cases)
