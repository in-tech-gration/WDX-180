/* Challenge: write this program using at least 1 `break`

  a user can provide input that is 10 characters long
    - given they cancel, a message is displayed and they are prompted again
    - given the input is too short, they are told how much too short and prompted again
    - given the input is too long, they are told how much too long and prompted again
    - given the input is 10 characters, the loop will exit and the input is alerted

  test cases:
    invalid input:
      (no test cases! the loop will not exit so there will be no output to test)
    input of 10 characters
      'javascript' -> 'javascript'
      '0123456789' -> '0123456789'
      'a b c d e ' -> 'a b c d e '

/* --- create final output --- */

/*
  checklist:
    [ ] the code is formatted
    [ ] linting check passes
    [ ] variable names are clear and helpful
    [ ] each line of code is explained in a comment above that line
      - use full sentences and correct JS vocabulary
    [ ] the program runs
    [ ] the program has no errors
    [ ] all of the test cases work
    [ ] you tested strange inputs that could break your program (edge cases)
