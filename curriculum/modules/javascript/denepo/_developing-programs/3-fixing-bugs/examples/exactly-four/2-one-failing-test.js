  you will focus on fixing ONLY that test case for now

  a user can enter a number and know if it is 4 characters long
  - given the input is null, they canceled :(
  - given the input is sorter than 4, it is too short
  - given the input is longer than 4, it is too long
  - given the input is exactly 4 characters, it's perfect

  test cases:
  - given the input is null
    null -> 'you canceled :('
  - given the input is shorter than 4
    '' -> 'too short'
    'ab' -> 'too short'
    'abc' -> 'too short'
  - given the input is exactly 4
    'abcd' -> 'perfect!'
  - given the input is longer than 4
    'abcde' -> 'too long'
    'abcdef' -> 'too long'
