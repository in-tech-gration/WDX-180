/* actual behavior

  before looking too closely at the code, take some time to understand what it DOES do

  a good way to explain what the code DOES do is to see which test cases fail
  so run the program a few times trying out each test case

/* exactly 4

  a user can enter a number and know if it is 4 characters long
  - given the input is null, they canceled :(
  - given the input is sorter than 4, it is too short
  - given the input is longer than 4, it is too long
  - given the input is exactly 4 characters, it's perfect

  test cases:
  - given the input is null
    null -> 'you canceled :('
  - given the input is shorter than 4
    '' -> 'too short'
    'ab' -> 'too short'
    'abc' -> 'too short'
  - given the input is exactly 4
    'abcd' -> 'perfect!'
  - given the input is longer than 4
    'abcde' -> 'too long'
    'abcdef' -> 'too long'
