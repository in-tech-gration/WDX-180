/* Error Name and Error Message

  the first and simplest part of describing an error is to name it

  the name and message for an error are logged at the top in your console
  - name will be the same in all browsers
  - messages may change depending on which browser you are in

  your errors will probably say Uncaught, you can ignore that for now

  go ahead and fill in the "name" and "message" fields in your error description

  About Searching for Help:

  When searching online for help with your errors, it's important to include:
  - environment
  - name
  - message

  the more information you include in you search the better ...
  ... except for your program's variable names and file names!

  Some error messages will contain information that is specific to your program
  you do not need to include this in your search, for example:

    ReferenceError: redApples is not defined

  redApples is a variable name in your program, not general information about your error:

    ReferenceError: _ is not defined

  leaving out the variable name will give you the same search results
