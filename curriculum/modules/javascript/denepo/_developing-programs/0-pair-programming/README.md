# Pair Programming

[Pair programming](https://gist.github.com/healeycodes/5acc53131957f6a96a281c89890c7706)
is a simple idea that takes some practice to get used to. In pair programming
you have two people at one computer working on a single project. Each person
takes turns in these two roles:

- **Navigator**: You are the one deciding how to approach the problem and what
  code to write, but you will not be the one typing it! You will explain your
  ideas to the Driver who will actually write the code. The Driver can ask
  questions and challenge your ideas, but ultimately you get to decide what is
  written.
- **Driver**: You are the one actually typing, moving the mouse, and using the
  computer, but you ultimately write what the Navigator is thinking. As a Driver
  you will ask questions and challenge the Navigator's ideas, but the Navigator
  has the final say on what code is written.

## Practice

[PuzzleCode](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/resources/javascript/puzzlecode/) is a great place for learning to pair
program, the website has simple coding challenges with a minimal programming
language that you can figure out in a minute. Because the language is simple and
there is no setup required, you can get right into Pair Programming without
getting caught up in details.

After you've spent some time practicing both roles (_Navigator & Driver_) on
PuzzleCode you will be ready for Pair Programming with JavaScript.

Enjoy!
