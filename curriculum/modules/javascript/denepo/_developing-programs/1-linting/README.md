# Linting

There is more to writing good code than writing correct syntax. You also want to
write code clearly and consistently so that other people can easily focus on
what your program should do and not on why you wrote such strange code.

Linting is all about making your code easier to read and easier to understand.

Linters are a type of tool used by developers to check the style of their code.
Linting is _static analysis_, that means it checks your code _without running_
the program. So there are lots of errors that linting will not catch. And many
things that are not a JavaScript error will be caught by linting.

There are a couple exercises in this folder to introduce you to linting, but
this is not all! Linting is something you should explore little by little with
every program you ever write or study.

Keep an eye out for linting mistakes in the More Cat Detectors chapter, they can
help you understand what makes one program easier to read than another.

These exercises each focus on one important rule from the ESLint configuration
in this repository. There are many more rules than this, it's just enough to
give you an idea of how to fix linting issues in JS.

Using the feedback from the `[eslint]` button see if you can rewrite the code to
behave the same, without having any linting errors.

There are many more rules! You can read about them all at
[eslint.org/docs/rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules), and you can try them all
out at [eslint.org/demo](https://eslint.org/demo).

To see (some of) the configuration for this repo check out `/.eslintrc.json` in
the top directory.
