### Study Plan

  Let's learn the **CSS Object Model**

  > "The CSS Object Model is a set of APIs allowing the manipulation of CSS from JavaScript. 
  >
  > It is much like the DOM, but for the CSS rather than the HTML. 
  >
  > It allows users to read and modify CSS style dynamically."

  - Slowly go through this lengthy article: [**A Beginnerâ€™s Guide To CSS Object Model (CSSOM)**](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/css-object-model/){:target="_blank"}

  In this article you'll find the word `Interface` mentioned quite a lot, so let's ask `ChatGPT` to explain this to us:

  **What is an Interface?**

  > "In the world of programming and computer science, an "interface" refers to a set of rules or specifications that define how different software components can interact with each other. It's like a contract that outlines what methods or functions an object or component should have and how they should behave.
  >
  > Think of it as a way for different parts of a program to communicate with each other without needing to know all the nitty-gritty details of how each part is implemented. **It's a bit like using a remote control to interact with your TV. You don't need to know exactly how the TV works internally; you just need to know the buttons on the remote control and what they do (that's the interface).**
  >
  > In the context of MDN documentation, when you see terms like "CSSStyleSheet", "Event interface", "FocusEvent interface," "UIEvent interface," etc., they are referring to specific sets of rules that describe what properties and methods an object (e.g. an Event object) should have. These interfaces tell developers what they can expect from these objects and how they can work with them."
