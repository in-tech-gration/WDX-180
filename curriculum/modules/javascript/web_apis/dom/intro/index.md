### Study Plan

  > "The making of good software takes time.
  > If you try to make it take less time, it will take more time."

  Starting today, **there's a new requirement for you**. 

  ![](./assets/bug_journal.png)
    
  Under the `user/` folder, you'll find a new `bug_journal/` folder that contains a sample file called `BUG_JOURNAL.draft.md`.  Copy this file, rename it to `BUG_JOURNAL.md` and **start tracking your bugs** from now on. You'll find a small example inside the draft (you can remove it from your copy) to give you an idea on what to look for and how to document each bug. There's a long and short version of bug reporting. Use the one that fits your style and mode of operation.

  > "The worst thing you can do is to ignore your mistakes. Don't get into the bad habit of error amnesia. You should be learning from your mistakes and the only way to learn from your mistakes is to pay attention to them." ~ Douglas Crockford

  > Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
  > Jorge Santayana

  The import steps are:

  - Make sure to pay attention to the bugs and errors in your code
  - When they happen, stop for a moment and document them
  - Write a brief description of the bug/error
  - Include a small code replicating the bug 
  - Try to categorize the bug (in any way you want)
  - Think about what caused the bug
  - Think about ways to detect, protect the code from or avoid the bug altogether in the future

  Why should you do this?

  - Stop making the same mistakes again and again!
  - Develop safer, more stable and bug-free software by learning how you've failed in the past
  - Nothing is a more valuable lesson that our failures

  - [Watch: **HTML vs DOM? Let’s debug them**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-02VNxE7lE){:target="_blank"} to understand the basic difference between these two very crucial concepts in Web Development and start building an intuition around the Document Object Model (DOM).
    - **Duration:** 5min
    - **Level:** Beginner

  <!-- SGEN:META:PROGRESS:task=Complete the interactive tutorials at 'Get started with viewing and changing the DOM' -->
  - **Practice time!** Now that you know the difference between HTML and the DOM, and got a first test of working with the DOM using the `DevTools`, it's time to practice those skills and become comfortable with DOM manipulation.
    - Go through this [**document**](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/){:target="_blank"} and stop at each section to practice the command or tool described in your browser.
  
  <!-- TODO: Integrate into the curriculum (as a Module?): https://github.com/GoogleChrome/developer.chrome.com/blob/main/site/en/docs/devtools/dom/index.md -->
  <!-- TODO: Convert interactive tutorial steps into progress steps -->

  <!-- TODO: Review + Add Practice -->
  - Watch lessons 1-7* from [**JavaScript DOM Manipulation Mastery: A Comprehensive Guide**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGkc6dKUZ84){:target="_blank"} and try to replicate as much as you can in your local environment.
    - **Duration:** 65min
    - **Level:** Intermediate

  _*up to `LESSON 8: DOM EVENT BASICS` section, around 01:04:46_
