  **Simple Manipulation - Part 02**
  
  <!-- SGEN:META:PROGRESS:task=Complete the exercise 'Simple Manipulation - Part 02'|user_folder=simple_manipulation -->
  <!-- SGEN:META:TESTS:name=Test Exercise: 'Simple Manipulation - Part 02'|type=exist|user_folder=simple_manipulation|files=dom.html,dom.js -->
  In this exercise, we want you to copy the folder (`simple_manipulation/`) with the files you've submitted for the exercise from Part 01, and complete the task found below:

  Copy the folder `curriculum/week{{ SGEN:WEEK_NUM }}/exercises/dom_mini_project/` inside folder `user/week{{ SGEN:WEEK_NUM }}/exercises/day{{ SGEN:DAY_NUM }}/` and complete all the challenges found below. Apply all the styles and functionality using JavaScript only.
