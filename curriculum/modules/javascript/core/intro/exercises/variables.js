  JavaScript Variables

  Challenge 1: calculate the sum of two numbers (e.g. 5 + 10)

  -> declare two variables
  -> store the sum to a third variable
  -> output the result to the console
  
  Your final result should look like the following: `X plus Y equals Z`

  Challenge 2: calculate the remainder of dividing two numbers (e.g. 29 รท 3)
  
  -> declare two variables
  -> store the remainder to a third variable
  -> output the result to the console
  
  Your final result should look like the following: `The remainder of X รท Y is Z`
