  JavaScript Loops

  Challenge 1: 
  
  -> write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20
  -> will check if the current number is even or odd
  -> print that to the console (e.g. "2 is even")

  Challenge 2:

  -> write a while a loop that runs as long as i is less than 10
  -> for each iteration print i to the console

  Challenge 3:

  -> write a while loop that runs as long as i is less than 10, but increase i with 2 each time
  -> for each iteration print i to the console

  Challenge 4:

  -> declare two variables, "character" and "timesToRepeat"
  -> using a loop, repeat each character that many times
  -> console.log the output

  example:  if I had character = 'f' and timesToRepeat = 5, it'd console.log 'fffff'

  Try a few different combinations to make sure you got it right e.g. 'a' and 10, 'c' and 100, '🐶' and 3.
