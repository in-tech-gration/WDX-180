#### Intro to Objects

  So far we've talked about having one variable at a time: one first name, one last name, one price, etc. What if we have a collection of data? It'd be nice to group together like data. Good news! You can!

  ```javascript
  const person = {
    name: "Brian Holt",
    city: "Seattle",
    state: "WA",
    favoriteFood: "üåÆ",
    wantsTacosRightNow: true,
    numberOfTacosWanted: 100,
  };
  console.log(person);
  console.log(person.name);
  console.log(person["name"]); // same as the line above; prefer using the other one
  ```

  This is called an object. They're extremely useful in JavaScript; they're how you'll group together like-information so that they can be used together. They contain a bunch of **keys** and **values**. The keys are on the left side of the `:` and represent how you get that piece data of out of the object. `name` is one such key, and the way I get the name of the

  Used in conjunction with functions they're very powerful. Take this example:

  ```javascript
  const person1 = {
    name: "Angie",
    ageRange: "25-35",
  };
  const person2 = {
    name: "Francesca",
    ageRange: "65-75",
  };

  function suggestMusic(person) {
    if (person.ageRange === "25-35") {
      console.log("We think you will like Daft Punk.");
    } else if (person.ageRange === "65-75") {
      console.log("You are obviously going to like Johnny Cash.");
    } else {
      console.log(
        "Uh, maybe try David Bowie? Everyone likes David Bowie, right?"
      );
    }
  }

  suggestMusic(person1);
  suggestMusic(person2);
  ```

  Now we're able to pass all this information as one package which makes it easy to keep track of since we're just passing one variable. You'll see this become even more useful as we start integrating with servers and APIs.

  Objects can even have their functions! Let's see that.

  ```javascript
  const dog = {
    name: "dog",
    speak() {
      console.log("woof woof");
    },
  };

  dog.speak();
  ```

  Objects can as well have nested objects inside of them.

  ```javascript
  const me = {
    name: {
      first: "Brian",
      last: "Holt",
    },
    location: {
      city: "Seattle",
      state: "WA",
      country: "USA",
    },
  };

  console.log(me.name.first);
  console.log(me.location.state);
  ```

#### Context

  Given an object with a person's address, wouldn't it be nice if we could use a function to print out a properly formatted shipping address?

  ```javascript
  const me = {
    name: {
      first: "Brian",
      last: "Holt",
    },
    location: {
      streetNumber: 500,
      street: "Fakestreet",
      city: "Seattle",
      state: "WA",
      zipCode: 55555,
      country: "USA",
    },
    getAddress() {
      return `${this.name.first} ${this.name.last}
  ${this.location.streetNumber} ${this.location.street}
  ${this.location.city}, ${this.location.state} ${this.location.zipCode}
  ${this.location.country}`;
    },
  };

  console.log(me.getAddress());
  ```

  This is our first time seeing the weird `this` keyword. This is a strange, complicated, and difficult concept in JavaScript known as context and trips up all sorts of people, new and old to the language. If you decide to pursue a career as a developer, interviewers will often ask questions about context in JavaScript. It's worth investment to understand how it works eventually (not now, focus just on basic JS for now.)

  In the simplest form, anywhere you are in JavaScript you have a context you are in. You can reference that context by using `this`. If I just reference `this` from the outermost layer, it'll be the global object, which in the browser is something called `window`. `window` already has a bunch of stuff on it. For example:

  ```javascript
  console.log(this === window);
  console.log(this.scrollY);
  console.log(window.scrollY);
  ```

  As you can see from the first line, you can see that in this context, window is the `this` at that time. However, in the example above when we're doing the address, the `this` is the object since when I **call the function**, it's created inside of an object. That object then becomes `this` when `getAddress` is called. As soon as the function completes, the context is destroyed and the context goes back to being what it was before, in this case, `window`.

  A good rule of thumb (that is unfortunately not always true) is that if you're inside an object of some sort, the `this` will be that object. If not, it'll be the global object, `window`. There are crazy exceptions to this and you can even manipulate it yourself. For now, operate with that definition. It's a deep-and-dark rabbit hole to go down so let's continue and you can check the [extras](#extra-resources) for a more in-depth look.
