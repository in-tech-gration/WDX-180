### Study Plan

#### Objects

  An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.

  Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

   - Captions: Yes

  Now that you have a good understanding of what Javascript Objects are, you can start playing around with some code.

  Make sure to follow the guides on **Setting up Study Lenses (v2) on your System**. Once `lenses2` is properly installed on your system, you can go to your `WDX-180` folder and run `lenses2` with the material for this Module:

  - `cd WDX-180/`
  - `lenses2 curriculum/modules/javascript/denepo/_inside-js/9-multiple-interactions/`

  You should focus and study the following modules (included within `9-multiple-interactions/`):

  - **1-isolate**

  - Based on [this reference](https://flexbox.malven.co/){:target="_blank"} and the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction#formal_definition){:target="_blank"}, complete the following object structure:

  ```js
  const flexboxProperties = {
    container: {
      display: {
        flex: {},
        "inline-flex": {}
      },
      "flex-direction": {
        row: { "initial-value": true },
        "row-reverse": {},
        column: {}
