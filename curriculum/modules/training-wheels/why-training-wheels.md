**What's the purpose of this?**

Just like training wheels on a bicycle, `programming training wheels` act as our support and reminders in our first rides with JavaScript. Their role is to instill some core concepts, avoid bugs and common beginner mistakes and also get us accustomed with some of the good practices.

> "The functionality of training wheels is based on the premise that a learner rider can gradually develop their balance and coordination skills by relying on the support of the extra wheels. As the rider gains confidence and proficiency, the training wheels are gradually raised or removed, theoretically allowing the rider to transition to riding without additional support." ~ Wikipedia
