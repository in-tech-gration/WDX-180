  **The Box Model**

  In a web page, **every element is rendered as a rectangular box**. The box model describes how the element’s content, padding, border, and margin determine the space occupied by the element and its relation to other elements in the page.

  Depending on the element’s display property, its box may be one of two types: a **block box** or an **inline box**.
