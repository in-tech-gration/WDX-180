### Summary

Congratulations! You now know how to spice up your HTML using CSS. 

You should by now have a good understanding of how CSS uses various selectors to target HTML elements and apply various CSS rules to them and style them.

Apart from creating HTML content and styling it with CSS, you also have some insight on how to publish and deploy your web pages on the Internet.

### Exercises

  **Styling the world's first website**: Visit this [link](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html){:target="_blank"} to see the world's first web page created by the inventor of the Web and HTML, [Tim Berners Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee){:target="_blank"}! 
  
  You can use Chrome's `View Source` functionality _(right-click anywhere on the web page to see the option appear)_ to check the source code. As you can see, this is a pretty old HTML standard! 
  
  **Your task is to rewrite the code** of this webpage in modern HTML (v5) and style it using CSS! Once everything is ready, make sure that your code lives under the `user/week01/exercises/day04/cern/` directory, commit and push to submit your solution to your forked repository.
