### Study Plan

  Watch the following videos from the [How the Internet Works](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfMRZm5DDxco3UdsFegvuB7) YouTube Playlist.

  In total, the duration of these videos is around 58min, which means that it will probably take you 1.5x to 2x times the time (90min~120min) to go through them, keep notes and questions and re-watch parts that were hard to grasp.

  For every single resources, make sure to keep notes, write down questions about parts of the content that seem unclear or difficult to grasp and update the progress Google Sheet accordingly.

  **What you'll learn:**

  - What is the Internet and how it works
  - What is the World Wide Web (web for short)
  - Internet Protocols
  - Internet communication
  - Public Key Cryptography
  - Internet Protocol (IPv4, IPv6)
  - DNS
  - Packets
  - Search engine crawlers (spiders)

  **Some of the questions you'll be able to answer:**

  - What is the Internet and who owns it?
  - How does the Internet share information?
  - What are the shortcomings of wireless communication?
  - Why is IPv6 better than IPv4?
  - What is DNS and how does the DNS servers work?
  - What are packets?
  - How can a single image be sent through the internet?
  - How to prevent hackers from snooping and tampering websites?
	- What are security protocols?
  - What is public key and private key?
  - What is a spider program?
	- What is the use of AI/ML to search a page?
  - What are the technologies that underlay the Web?

  Before we dive into a more detailed description of the Internet's most interesting part, the Web, let's do a quick recap on how the Internet works by [**watching this short video**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/7_LPdttKXPc?start=29&end=272){:target="_blank"} that summarizes the concepts you've learned so far and contains some really nice visuals that will help you create a mental model of the Internet backbone. 
  
  The nice diagrams that show how devices on the Internet are connected and communicate with each other, along with the [cool animation](https://www.youtube.com/embed/7_LPdttKXPc?start=161&end=176){:target="_blank"} showing how various media files are moved across the Internet as small packets, are a great way to keep these concepts in your mind.

  After you've watched the video, **make sure to take a short break**, stretch your legs, arms and neck, give your eyes a break by looking at a distance for at least 20 seconds and briefly describe the main concepts that you've learned to yourself.

### Summary

  You've just uncovered the marvelous world of the Internet and the (World Wide) Web! Pat yourself in the back, as you went through a lot of concepts which are quite hard to grasp. 

  At this point, you should have a high level overview of how Internet and the Web are working and are interrelated. The Internet is basically a way to connect all of the world's computers and digital devices together, whereas the Web allows for some of these devices to share documents (called web pages) with other devices based on some common language and standards.
