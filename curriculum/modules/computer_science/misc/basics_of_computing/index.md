  > Inspirational Quote of the Day: _"If you fail, never give up because F.A.I.L. means FIRST ATTEMPT IN LEARNING"_

  - Welcome Session _(*enrolled students)_
  - Setting up and getting to know each other
  - [Study](#study-plan)
  - [Exercises](#exercises)
  - [Extra Resources](#extra-resources)

### Study Plan

  Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/CAek8fVB70M){:target="_blank"} that will guide you through the process of keeping your forked WDX-180 repo up-to-date with our latest content and curriculum updates.

  Next, watch the following videos which give a brief introduction to the 0s and 1s that make computers tick. The total duration of these videos is around 31 minutes.

  **YouTube Tips - (1) grabbing screenshots and (2) customizing the playback speed:** 
  
  (1) Sometimes you want to easily grab screenshots from particular segments of a video, e.g. a nice diagram, a frame that contains a code sample or a part that contains links. You can install and use [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screenshot-youtube/gjoijpfmdhbjkkgnmahganhoinjjpohk){:target="_blank"} to easily grab a screenshot at any point.  
  
  (2) When watching YouTube videos that are either too slow or too fast for you to follow along, remember these speed shortcuts:

  **What you'll learn:**

  - Binary digits (bits)
  - How we represent text, images, video and audio using binary
  - ASCII, Unicode & UTF-8
  - Pixels (picture elements)
  - Digital file compression
  - How we calculate storage in computers 
  - Hexadecimal number system

  **Some of the questions you'll be able to answer:**

  - How many numbers can you store with 8 bits?
  - What is Lossy and Lossless Compression?
  - How is color stored and represented in computers?
  - What is the difference between a Kilobyte and a Kibibyte?
  - What is ASCII?
  - What is the standard text encoding for the Web?
  - How do computers deal with large numbers?
  - How do computers deal with negative numbers?
  - How do computers deal with floating point numbers?
