### Study Plan

  - Watch [What is RAG?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtIyQPJUd_U){:target="_blank"}
    > Notes: Disregard the promotional mention about the Qdrant service.

  - Fork the [LangChain-RAG](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/LangChain-RAG){:target="_blank"} repo.
  - Watch the [Building a RAG Application using LangChain.js](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo7hJB0agElRmR33xq3x2lTFDaiwqg88){:target="_blank"} video series and follow the tutorial by running each step locally.

### Extra Resources

  - Watch [Beyond the Hype: A Realistic Look at Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv0cfsastFs){:target="_blank"} _(You probably don't need to watch the Python coding at the end as it is covered by the JavaScript code above)_
