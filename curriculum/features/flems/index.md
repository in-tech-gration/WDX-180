# Let's test some interactive code playground!

3 simple steps to enable a `Flems` live code playground after each code block:

1) Define a coding area using a fenced code block

2) Add a button, directly below the fenced code block using an `#flems-enable` HREF as shown in the example below:

~~~
```js
const a = 42;
const b = 2;
console.log( a * b );
```

3) Include the following content in the Markdown Frontmatter:

```
---
load_script_js_via_src:
  - flems/flems.html
  - flems/flems_init.js
---
```

You are good to go!

Supported languages (at this point): `js` and `html`.
