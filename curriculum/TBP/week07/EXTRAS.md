  - [Listen: **What is a Memory Leak?** Kopec Explains Software Podcast](http://kopec.live/episode/3aa2ed3f/what-is-a-memory-leak-)
    - Description: _"Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory and fails to free it when the memory is no longer being used. They can cause the memory use of a program to balloon over time, eventually leading to performance problems or a crash. They are a common programmer error, that has been alleviated, although not eliminated, by modern programming languages."_
