  </summary>

### Schedule

  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  The plan for today and tomorrow is to study the following article by `Dan Abramov*`:

  - [**A Complete Guide to useEffect**](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/){:target="_blank"}

  This is a long, lengthy article that goes into deep details about the `useEffect` Hook and the Components' lifecycle. 

  It is highly recommended that you read the full article as it provides some very important concepts and rules that you must know if you want to master `React`. That's why we split this task in two days. 

  Here are some of the main points covered in the the article:

  - How do I replicate `componentDidMount**` with useEffect?
  - How do I correctly fetch data inside useEffect? What is []?
  - Do I need to specify functions as effect dependencies or not?
  - Why do I sometimes get an infinite refetching loop?
  - Why do I sometimes get an old state or prop value inside my effect?

  Make sure to open up all the `Codesandbox` demos provided in the article and study and experiment with the code.

  *_(Dan Abramov is a core contributor to React and the creator of Redux)_

  **_(componentDidMount is a special lifecycle method used in Class Components that gets called when the component has been mounted. More about Class Components and `componentDidMount` [here](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component){:target="_blank"})_

  Go straight to the **Exercises** section below and start on your final React challenge to complete the 2nd part of WDX180.

<!-- Summary -->

### Exercises

Today and the rest of this week is all about practicing your React skills.

The main goal is to deliver a fully functional React quiz app by the end of the week and receive your digital certificates*.

You'll find the requirements/specifications and some guidelines here:

[https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/curriculum/modules/javascript/frameworks/react/exercises/simple-quiz/](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/curriculum/modules/javascript/frameworks/react/exercises/simple-quiz/){:target="_blank"}

Good luck! ðŸ˜Ž

  **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheet for this day is: **/user/week24/progress/progress.draft.w24.d03.csv**

  You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](../modules/curriculum/progress_workflow.md).
