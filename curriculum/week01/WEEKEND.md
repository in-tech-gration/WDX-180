These are some recommendations for a more relaxing but still insightful and informative weekend. Enjoy!

- Watch the BBC documentary [**Calculating Ada - The Countess of Computing**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgUVrzkQgds)
  - Description: _"Ada Lovelace was a most unlikely computer pioneer. In this film, Dr Hannah Fry tells the story of Ada's remarkable life. Born in the early 19th century Ada was a countess of the realm, a scandalous socialite and an 'enchantress of numbers'. The film is an enthralling tale of how a life infused with brilliance, but blighted by illness and gambling addiction, helped give rise to the modern era of computing."_
