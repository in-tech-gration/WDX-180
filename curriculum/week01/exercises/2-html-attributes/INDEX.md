# HTML Attributes

Luke has sent a map to iCafe. Using HTML attributes, we can turn this into a link that we can click on. Won has responded with a funny gif. Wouldn't it be nice if we showed it as an image in the message?

Complete the following steps in the `index.html` file:

1. In Luke's message, use the `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute to turn the word "iCafe" into a link that can be clicked.

2. In Won's message, use the `<img>` tag with the `src` attribute to show the funny gif in the message.

3. When you are finished, use git to add, commit and push your changes.

```
git add <ADD_APPROPRIATE_FOLDER_HERE>
git commit -m "Completed 2-html-attributes exercise"
git push
```

If you are having trouble, review the following information about HTML [Attributes](https://marksheet.io/html-syntax.html#attributes), [Links](https://marksheet.io/html-links.html) and [Images](https://marksheet.io/html-images.html).
