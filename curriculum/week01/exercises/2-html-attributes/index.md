# HTML Attributes

Luke has sent a map to iCafe. Using HTML attributes, we can turn this into a link that we can click on. Won has responded with a funny gif. Wouldn't it be nice if we showed it as an image in the message?

Complete the following steps in the `index.html` file:

1. In Luke's message, use the `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute to turn the word "iCafe" into a link that can be clicked.

2. In Won's message, use the `<img>` tag with the `src` attribute to show the funny gif in the message.

3. When you are finished, use git to add, commit and push your changes.

4. You'll have to copy the files existing in the folder and place them in the corresponding folder inside your `user/` folder.

For example:

- Copy all files in folder `2-html-attributes`
- Paste them inside folder `user/week01/exercises/day03/2-html-attributes/`
- Work on the copied files and complete the exercise.
- Upload (push) to your repo.

```bash
git add user/week01/exercises/day03/2-html-attributes/
git commit -m "Completed 2-html-attributes exercise"
git push
```
