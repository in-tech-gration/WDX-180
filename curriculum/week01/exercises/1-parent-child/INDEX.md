# Parent-Child Relationships

There are two messages in this example. The time that the message was sent is displayed for the first message, but it is missing in the second message. Complete the following steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file and add the time `7:15pm` to the second message using the correct HTML syntax. You will need to identify the correct location in the code to add a new tag and make sure that you give it the correct class attribute.

2. Use git to add, commit and push your changes.

```
git add <ADD_APPROPRIATE_FOLDER_HERE>
git commit -m "Completed 1-parent-child exercise"
git push
```

_Hint: Use the first message as an example to help you write the second message correctly._
