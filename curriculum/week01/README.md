    - Reading time: 5min
    - Level: Beginner

  Before we dive into a more detailed description of the Internet's most interesting part, the Web, let's do a quick recap on how the Internet works by [**watching this short video**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/7_LPdttKXPc?start=29&end=272) that summarizes the concepts you've learned so far and contains some really nice visuals that will help you create a mental model of the Internet backbone. 
  
  The nice diagrams that show how devices on the Internet are connected and communicate with each other, along with the [cool animation](https://www.youtube.com/embed/7_LPdttKXPc?start=161&end=176) showing how various media files are moved across the Internet as small packets, are a great way to keep these concepts in your mind.

  After you've watched the video, **make sure to take a short break**, stretch your legs, arms and neck, give your eyes a break by looking at a distance for at least 20 seconds and briefly describe the main concepts that you've learned to yourself.

  **What you'll learn: Getting started with the web: HTML**

  It's a lot of work to create a professional website, so if you're new to web development, we encourage you to start small. You won't build another Facebook right away, but it's not hard to make your own simple website online, so we'll start there.

  By studying the material and following the instructions, you will go from nothing to getting your first webpage online. Let's begin our journey!

  - [Read: **What will your website look like?**](resources/What%20will%20your%20website%20look%20like/README.md)
  - [Read: **HTML Basics**](resources/HTML_Basics/README.md)
  
  Now, that we have a good grasp of HTML, let's learn a little bit about another markup language called **Markdown**, that is going to come in handy in a lot of situations.

  > **TIP: Variables are NOT placeholders for values!**
  > 
  > You will often find several sources (videos, blog posts, tutorials, etc.) describing **variables as placeholders** or boxes that store values. Even though this mental model might help someone who goes through this important programming concept for the first time, it is actually **a flawed way of thinking** about variables, as [Felienne Hermans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felienne/) points out in her book ["The Programmer's Brain"](https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain):
  > 
  > _"Thinking of a variable as a box that holds a value does not adequately support thinking about reassignment. Will the second value fit in the box with the first value? Or will the first value be pushed out?"_ 
  > 
  > _"When we learn to program, thinking of a variable like a box that holds a value is helpful. However, after a while, we realize that a variable cannot hold more than one value, so alternatively, you might think of a variable like a name tag or label you attach to a value."_
  > 
  > Even though, the author also points out that _"Both mental models can exist at the same time and might have benefits in different situations."_ it is recommended to stick with the notion that "a variable in JS is a label that references a value in memory somewhere". This notion also coincides with how programming languages actually work under the hood.

  > **TIP #2:** Wondering if you can use a given string as a variable name in JavaScript? Use [this tool](https://mothereff.in/js-variables) to find out! 
  >
  > _(Don't forget to star the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/mothereff.in) if you found this tool helpful.)_
  >
  > Some names you thought couldn't be used but are valid names:
  >
  > `const το_όνομά_μου = "My name in greek";`
  >
  > `const こんにちは = "Hello in Japanese";`
  >
  > `const _______ = "WTF?";`
  >
  > Names you thought were valid, but aren't:
  >
  > `const 123vroom = "Nope`;
  >
  > `const delete = "Nope`;
  >
  > `const continue = false`;
  >
  > `const default = 10`;
  >
  > `const package = "Delivered"`;
  >
  > `const protected = "Area"`;
  >
  > `const private = "Area"`;
  >
  > `const ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ = "Nope`;

  ---

  **Template Literals:** Apart from the familiar "double" and 'single' quotes to define a String in JavaScript, there's also the \`backtick\` characters that are used to define a String value. Also, called template literals, this format allows us to define plain text values inside a String along with dynamic values enclosed in a special dollar sign brackes syntax: `${}`:

  ```js
  const name = "Brendan";
  const last = "Eich";
  const string = `${name} ${last} created JavaScript.`
  // Output: "Brendan Eich created JavaScript."

  **Tip:** You are probably a bit confused at this point about the difference between `isNaN` and `Number.isNaN` when checking for equality with the `NaN` value. You will read more about this in upcoming modules. For now, to keep things simple, just remember to stick `Number.isNaN`, as it is safer and more reliable.

  > **What's up with number 42?** You probably see a lot of tutorials and blog posts using number 42 as the value for various examples, and wondering what's the deal with this number. 
  >
  > According to Wikipedia: "The number 42 is, in _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ by Douglas Adams, the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything", calculated by an enormous supercomputer named Deep Thought over a period of 7.5 million years. Unfortunately, no one knows what the question is." [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number))

  **Tip:** Nested ternary operators are hard to read and even harder to maintain, so try to avoid them as much as possible.

  ```js
  const test = 54;
  const grade = test > 90 ? "A" : test > 70 ? "B" : "C";

  // Instead, write it like this:

  const isAbove90 = test > 90;
  const isAbove70 = test > 70;

  let grade = "C";

  if ( isAbove70 ){
    grade = "B";
  }

  if ( isAbove90 ){
    grade = "A";
  }
  ```

  As you can see, the second example is more verbose, but nevertheless it's much easier to read and reason about. In order to test whether one syntax is more reliable and maintainable than the other, try to update both versions of the code with the next 2 new requirements. After you've updated the code, compare the resulting code. Which one makes more sense and is more readable?

  - All test scores above 97 should be graded "A+"
  - All test scores above 80 should be graded "B+"

  ### Summary

  - The JavaScript programming language can be found running on several environments (e.g. inside a browser, on an operating system via Node.js, etc.)

  - The core features of the language covered in this brief introduction were:
    - Data and data types (string, number, boolean, undefined)
    - Defining, accessing and modifying variables
    - Conditionals: if/else/switch create a logical branching in our code, directing our program to different code paths depending on some or several conditions.
    - Working with numbers
    - The null coalescing operator (??)
    - Defining, accessing and manipulating Strings through:
      - The `.length` property
      - The `charAt()` method
      - The `indexOf()` method
      - The `slice()` method
      - The `toLowerCase()` method
      - The `toUpperCase()` method
      - The `trim()` method
    - Looping over some code using do/while/for loops
      - BE CAREFUL NOT TO CREATE an endless/infinite loop
    - Functions
    - Some Browser technologies (APIs) were also introduced:
      - The `alert()` method
      - The `confirm()` method
      - The `prompt()` method

  As you are embarking on your journey to harness the power of computers through programming and become a software developer, you must always remind to yourself that:

  - ***"The best part of programming is finding mistakes."***
  - ***"You will fail often, and it will be frustrating."***
  - ***"Never be afraid to mess around and experiment."***
