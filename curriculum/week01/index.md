# Week 1

_(Updated: 28/09/2023)_

Welcome to the first part of our curriculum, WDX 60¬∞. The goal of this first part, that will span 60 days, is to give you a basic understanding of how computers and the Internet work, how the World Wide Web _(or Web for short)_ which is built on top of them works and connects people and ideas together through the use of these 3 building blocks: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. By the end of this part of the course, you'd be able to code in these 3 languages and deploy your websites and web applications on the Web.  

Before you dive in, **make sure that you have your notebook** and colored pens besides your computer, in order to pause and take those invaluable notes as you move along the curriculum.

**Let's get started!**

### Exercises

  - **Decode the secret message**: watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSZOf9pyepc) from an episode of [Silicon Valley](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/) series and try to find and decode the hidden geeky message.

  Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheets are found in the `/user/weekXX/progress` folder, for example `user/week01/progress/progress.draft.w01.d01.csv`. You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](resources/PROGRESS-WORKFLOW.md).

  **It is absolutely crucial** at this point to remind you that updating the `Confidence` column in the progress sheets should reflect an honest and accurate self-evaluation score. You should not overestimate nor underestimate your level of confidence. A score that is closer to your real level of confidence will help you and others attend to your real needs and put focus on the parts that need some further knowledge re-enforcement and engagement.

### Summary

  You've just uncovered the marvelous world of the Internet and the (World Wide) Web! Pat yourself in the back, as you went through a lot of concepts which are quite hard to grasp. 

  At this point, you should have a high level overview of how Internet and the Web are working and are interrelated. The Internet is basically a way to connect all of the world's computers and digital devices together, whereas the Web allows for some of these devices to share documents (called web pages) with other devices based on some common language and standards.

### Exercises

  Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheets are found in the `/user/weekXX/progress` folder, for example `user/week01/progress/progress.draft.w01.d01.csv`. You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](resources/PROGRESS-WORKFLOW.md).

### Study Plan

  **What you'll learn: Getting started with the web: HTML**

  It's a lot of work to create a professional website, so if you're new to web development, we encourage you to start small. You won't build another Facebook right away, but it's not hard to make your own simple website online, so we'll start there.

  By studying the material and following the instructions, you will go from nothing to getting your first webpage online. Let's begin our journey!

  - [Read: **HTML**](resources/HTML.md) to get a quick introduction to HTML. 

  - [Read: **What will your website look like?**](resources/What_will_your_website_look_like/index.md)

  - [Read: **HTML Basics**](resources/HTML_Basics/index.md)
    - <details>
        <summary>What you'll learn</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>What is HTML?</li>
          <li>What is an Element?</li>
          <li>What is a Tag?</li>
          <li>What is the difference between a Tag and an Element?</li>
          <li>Anatomy of an HTML Element</li>
          <li>Attributes</li>
          <li>Nesting Elements</li>
          <li>Void Elements</li>

              <li>html</li>
              <li>head</li>
              <li>meta</li>
              <li>title</li>
              <li>body</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Images</li>
          <li>Headings</li>
          <li>Paragraphs</li>

          <li>Links</li>
          <li>HTML Entities</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
  
  Now, that we have a good grasp of HTML, let's learn a little bit about another markup language called **Markdown**, that is going to come in handy in a lot of situations.

  - [Read: **Getting Started with Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/){:target="_blank"}
    - If you found this article helpful, don't forget to give it a [GitHub star](https://github.com/mattcone/markdown-guide){:target="_blank"}.

  - [Take a look at this nice Markdown cheatsheet](https://commonmark.org/help/){:target="_blank"}
    - Take the [10 Minute Markdown tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/){:target="_blank"}
    - Don't forget to [give it a star](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-web){:target="_blank"}!

  Now it's a good time to bookmark this really useful website: [**htmlreference.io**](https://htmlreference.io/) is a free online guide to HTML. 
  
  Take a few minutes to browse through some of the available HTML elements, see them in action, check their syntax and the attributes they support. 
  
  Yes, they're quite a few of them (113), but don't worry too much though, as most of the times, you are probably going to need only a handful of them. 

### Summary

  Wow! You've covered quite a lot of ground right there! Through this module you've uncovered one of the most basic building blocks of the Web: HTML. The language that provides the content and gives structure to our web documents.

  You should be able to tell the difference between an HTML element and a tag, understand how HTML attributes are placed within the opening tags to provide extra functionality to the HTML elements and how nesting and hierarchy are important factors for a clean and well-formatted HTML documents.

  On top of HTML, you also learned about a very handy format, called `Markdown` which you are going to be seeing and using a lot in upcoming weeks.

  > **TIP: Variables are NOT placeholders for values!**
  > 
  > You will often find several sources (videos, blog posts, tutorials, etc.) describing **variables as placeholders** or boxes that store values. Even though this mental model might help someone who goes through this important programming concept for the first time, it is actually **a flawed way of thinking** about variables, as [Felienne Hermans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felienne/) points out in her book ["The Programmer's Brain"](https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain):
  > 
  > _"Thinking of a variable as a box that holds a value does not adequately support thinking about reassignment. Will the second value fit in the box with the first value? Or will the first value be pushed out?"_ 
  > 
  > _"When we learn to program, thinking of a variable like a box that holds a value is helpful. However, after a while, we realize that a variable cannot hold more than one value, so alternatively, you might think of a variable like a name tag or label you attach to a value."_
  > 
  > Even though, the author also points out that _"Both mental models can exist at the same time and might have benefits in different situations."_ it is recommended to stick with the notion that "a variable in JS is a label that references a value in memory somewhere". This notion also coincides with how programming languages actually work under the hood.

  > **TIP #2:** Wondering if you can use a given string as a variable name in JavaScript? Use [this tool](https://mothereff.in/js-variables) to find out! 
  >
  > _(Don't forget to star the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/mothereff.in) if you found this tool helpful.)_
  >
  > Some names you thought couldn't be used but are valid names:
  >
  > `const œÑŒø_œåŒΩŒøŒºŒ¨_ŒºŒøœÖ = "My name in greek";`
  >
  > `const „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ = "Hello in Japanese";`
  >
  > `const _______ = "WTF?";`
  >
  > Names you thought were valid, but aren't:
  >
  > `const 123vroom = "Nope`;
  >
  > `const delete = "Nope`;
  >

  **Demo time:** visit this [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/kostasx/LearnJavascript/tree/master/resources/youtube/coding.an.interactive.string.length.counter?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview){:target="_blank"} and update the string value (`Hello World!`) to see how the `.length` property of the String data type corresponds to the number of characters found in the String.

  ---

  **Template Literals:** Apart from the familiar "double" and 'single' quotes to define a String in JavaScript, there's also the \`backtick\` characters that are used to define a String value. Also, called template literals, this format allows us to define plain text values inside a String along with dynamic values enclosed in a special dollar sign brackes syntax: `${}`:

  ```js
  const name = "Brendan";
  const last = "Eich";
  const string = `${name} ${last} created JavaScript.`
  // Output: "Brendan Eich created JavaScript."

  **Tip:** You are probably a bit confused at this point about the difference between `isNaN` and `Number.isNaN` when checking for equality with the `NaN` value. You will read more about this in upcoming modules. For now, to keep things simple, just remember to stick `Number.isNaN`, as it is safer and more reliable.

          </ul>
      </details>

  **Tip:** Nested ternary operators are hard to read and even harder to maintain, so try to avoid them as much as possible.

  ```js
  const test = 54;
  const grade = test > 90 ? "A" : test > 70 ? "B" : "C";

  // Instead, write it like this:

  const isAbove90 = test > 90;
  const isAbove70 = test > 70;

  let grade = "C";

  if ( isAbove70 ){
    grade = "B";
  }

  if ( isAbove90 ){
    grade = "A";
  }
  ```

  As you can see, the second example is more verbose, but nevertheless it's much easier to read and reason about. In order to test whether one syntax is more reliable and maintainable than the other, try to update both versions of the code with the next 2 new requirements. After you've updated the code, compare the resulting code. Which one makes more sense and is more readable?

  - All test scores above 97 should be graded "A+"
  - All test scores above 80 should be graded "B+"

### Summary

  - The JavaScript programming language can be found running on several environments (e.g. inside a browser, on an operating system via Node.js, etc.)

  - The core features of the language covered in this brief introduction were:
    - Data and data types (string, number, boolean, undefined)
    - Defining, accessing and modifying variables
    - Conditionals: if/else/switch create a logical branching in our code, directing our program to different code paths depending on some or several conditions.
    - Working with numbers
    - The null coalescing operator (??)
    - Defining, accessing and manipulating Strings through:
      - The `.length` property
      - The `charAt()` method
      - The `indexOf()` method
      - The `slice()` method
      - The `toLowerCase()` method
      - The `toUpperCase()` method
      - The `trim()` method
    - Looping over some code using do/while/for loops
      - BE CAREFUL NOT TO CREATE an endless/infinite loop
    - Functions
    - Some Browser technologies (APIs) were also introduced:
      - The `alert()` method
      - The `confirm()` method
      - The `prompt()` method

  As you are embarking on your journey to harness the power of computers through programming and become a software developer, you must always remind to yourself that:

  - ***"The best part of programming is finding mistakes."***
  - ***"You will fail often, and it will be frustrating."***
  - ***"Never be afraid to mess around and experiment."***

### Exercises

  - Try to solve all the exercises found [here](./exercises/javascript-first-steps/index.md)

  Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheets are found in the `/user/weekXX/progress` folder, for example `user/week01/progress/progress.draft.w01.d01.csv`. You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](resources/PROGRESS-WORKFLOW.md).
