### Study Plan

  With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.

### Exercises

  There a lot of tools that can help a web developer check how good the performance of a website is. One of the best out there, and open source, is **Google Lighthouse**. Check the video below that covers the absolute basics of this simple but helpful tool

  [Watch: **What Is Google Lighthouse and How to Use It?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyaHwvPWuZU){:target="_blank"}

  After watching the video, it's time to give it a go by following these steps:

  <!-- TODO: Replace week01 + exercises-3 with dynamic links. There should be no references to particular Weeks or Days inside the Modules content -->


  - Head over to your GitHub Page where your solution from [the **Styling the world’s first website** exercise](/WDX-180/curriculum/week01/index.html#exercises-3){:target="_blank"} is published.
    - If you have not completed this exercise, now it's time to do so!
    <!-- TODO: Same as above. Replace references to weeks and days. -->
    - If you followed correctly the instructions provided you can find your solution following this link `https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/WDX-180/user/week01/exercises/day04/cern/index.html` by replacing `<GITHUB_USERNAME>` with your username.
  - While on this page, open Lighthouse, in any way you prefer (we're suggesting using the Chrome Dev Tools), and initiate a report for `Desktop` device by checking the following categories: `Performance`, `Accessibility`, `Best Practices`, `SEO`.
  - After the report is finished, check thoroughly what changes can be made to increase the score in any of the 4 categories, and try to improve your site's performance as much as possible!

  The goal is to have a score on all categories over 90. **Let's start analyzing this webpage**!

  **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheet for this day is: **/user/week04/progress/progress.draft.w04.d05.csv**

  You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](../week01/resources/PROGRESS-WORKFLOW.md).
