# Week 9 Weekend 

These are some recommendations for a more relaxing but still insightful, informative and inspirational weekend. Enjoy!

- [Watch **Good Tech for Hard Places: Fighting Ebola with JS Offline Apps**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sLjWlWvCsc){:target="_blank"}
  - **Duration:** 25min
  - **Description:** On 23rd July 2014, the first case of Ebola was reported in Nigeria, home to a small NGO working at the intersection of tech and public health. By then over 1000 cases had been reported in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. 
  
  - This is a story of how we use JavaScript to fight the Ebola outbreak. It’s also a story of building good tech for hard places, where a stable internet connection is rare and emergencies are real. There are a lot of awesome technologies (e.g. CouchDB and PouchDB) out there to help you build offline applications. 

  - There is also no shortage of beginner level online tutorials to show you how to do a quick and nice first prototype, but as in any new field there is not so much documentation available to help you solve the problems you’ll find when deploying your offline applications to be used in the “real” world. 
  - This talk will present some of these problems as well as the solutions we came up with, including some open source tools developed by ourselves.

- [Listen to **An Interview with Open Source Health IT Project: LibreHealth**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_S20RXhb18)
  - **Duration:** 25min
  - **Description:** LibreHealth is the largest health IT project to emerge recently, particularly in the area of free and open source software. In this video, Dr. Judy Gichoya of the LibreHealth project explains what clinicians in Africa are dealing with and what their IT needs are.

- [Read **This video game lets you step inside the shoes of a refugee**](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/02/can-a-video-game-save-a-life-african-refugee-puts-players-in-his-race-for-survival/)
  - **Description:** Mayen, who was born as his family traveled 250 miles (400 km) to escape South Sudan’s second civil war, hopes his game, Salaam, will give players a better understanding of what it means to be homeless, hungry and on the run.
