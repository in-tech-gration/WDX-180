### Study Plan

  Let's learn the **CSS Object Model**

  > "The CSS Object Model is a set of APIs allowing the manipulation of CSS from JavaScript. 
  >
  > It is much like the DOM, but for the CSS rather than the HTML. 
  >
  > It allows users to read and modify CSS style dynamically."



  - Slowly go through this lengthy article: [**A Beginner’s Guide To CSS Object Model (CSSOM)**](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/css-object-model/){:target="_blank"}

  ![](assets/DOM.CSSOM.png)

  In this article you'll find the word `Interface` mentioned quite a lot, so let's ask `ChatGPT` to explain this to us:

  **What is an Interface?**

  > "In the world of programming and computer science, an "interface" refers to a set of rules or specifications that define how different software components can interact with each other. It's like a contract that outlines what methods or functions an object or component should have and how they should behave.
  >
  > Think of it as a way for different parts of a program to communicate with each other without needing to know all the nitty-gritty details of how each part is implemented. **It's a bit like using a remote control to interact with your TV. You don't need to know exactly how the TV works internally; you just need to know the buttons on the remote control and what they do (that's the interface).**
  >
  > In the context of MDN documentation, when you see terms like "CSSStyleSheet", "Event interface", "FocusEvent interface," "UIEvent interface," etc., they are referring to specific sets of rules that describe what properties and methods an object (e.g. an Event object) should have. These interfaces tell developers what they can expect from these objects and how they can work with them."



  **CAUTION:** The ChatGPT response was reviewed and curated by our staff of professional developers. Never trust AI-generated responses 100%.

  Here is a list of the main concepts that you will learn in this article:

  - The `HTMLElement.style.*` set of properties
  - The `window.getComputedStyle(Element)` method
  - The `CSSStyleDeclaration Interface` and its properties:
    - `getPropertyValue()`
    - `getPropertyPriority()`
    - `setProperty(propertyName, value, priority)`
    - `removeProperty(property)`
    - `item()`
    - `length`
  - The `StyleSheet & StyleSheetList Interfaces` and their properties:
    - `disabled`
    - `href`
    - `media`
    - `ownerNode`
    - `parentStyleSheet`
    - `title`
    - `type`
    - `document.styleSheets.length`
  - The `CSSStyleSheet & CSSRule Interfaces`
    - `cssRules`
    - `deleteRule()`
    - `insertRule()`
    - `cssText`
    - `parentRule`
    - `parentStyleSheet`
  - The `CSSMediaRule & CSSKeyframeRule Interfaces`
    - `media`
    - `keyText`

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>
    <h2>
      <span class="summary-day">Week 13 - Day 3</span> | Promises & Scope</h2>
  </summary>

### Schedule

  - **Lecture: Promises & Scope**
  - **Practice**
  - **Work on Project (Group/Personal)**

### Study Plan

  ![](./assets/Knock.Knock.png)

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. The first part of the lecture is about Promises and error handling, while the second part is all about `scope` in JavaScript and different ways to define variables.  

  > A new term needs a proper Google search for its original definition:
  > 
  > **Scope:** *“the extent of the area or subject matter that something deals with or to which it is relevant.”*  
  > *Example: "we widened the scope of our investigation"*  



  - **Recommended reading:** read the full articles about [var](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var){:target="_blank"}, [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let){:target="_blank"} and [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const){:target="_blank"} on MDN and share your questions on our Slack forum or leave a comment below.

### Summary

  Here is an AI-generated summary of the lectures:

  **Lecture 1: Promises**

  1. **Creating promises**: The instructor explains how to create promises using the `Promise` constructor and provides examples.

  2. **Handling promise errors**: He demonstrates how to handle promise errors using `.catch()` or `.finally()`.

  3. **Chaining promises**: The discussion covers chaining promises together using the `.then()` method.

  4. **Combining promises**: The instructor shows how to combine multiple promises into a single promise using methods like `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`.

  5. **Performance measurement**: He mentions the importance of measuring performance in JavaScript and provides a link to an MDN API for timing functions.

  6. **Timing promise execution**: The discussion highlights that there's no way to guarantee the exact time it takes for promises to execute, even on the same machine.

  The meeting also touches upon related topics, such as:

  * Creating arrow functions with single statements
  * Combining multiple promise-based functions into a single function

  **Lecture 2: Scope**

  1. The concept of scope in JavaScript is important to understand.

  2. There are different types of scope: global, function, and block scope.

  3. Variables declared with `var` have function scope, while variables declared with `let` or `const` have block scope.

  4. Lexical scoping (also known as static scoping) is a way of resolving variable references in JavaScript.

  5. It's not necessary to know the term "lexical scoping" to understand how scope works in JavaScript; just learn the rules and you'll be fine.

  6. Naming variables can help with understanding scope, especially when working with complex code.

### Exercises

  - Practice with Promises and what you've learned from the lectures

  - Study the behavior of the following code, and make sure to understand the mechanics behind it and be able to explain this during a coding interview (practice by explaining this to an imaginary person or to a class mate):

  ```js
  console.log(a);
  var a = 42;
  console.log(a);

  console.log(b);
  let b = 42;
  console.log(b);
  ```

  **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheet for this day is: **/user/week13/progress/progress.draft.w13.d03.csv**

  You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](../modules/curriculum/progress_workflow.md).

### Summary

  ![](https://in-tech-gration.github.io/WDX-180/curriculum/modules/javascript/misc/post_mortem/assets/post_mortem.png)

  Let's begin by reading about [What is a Software Post-Mortem and How Do You Write One?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-software-post-mortem/){:target="_blank"}

  After having read the article, open up the code [found here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/modules/javascript/misc/post_mortem){:target="_blank"} debug the program and write a short post mortem.

  When you're done, take a short break and move on to the next section, where
  we switch gears and learn about the all powerful **CSS Grid**.  

  ---



  **Introduction to CSS Grid**

  ![](./assets/CSS.Grid.png)

  - Watch the lecture [here](https://youtu.be/9164u4MbdHo){:target="_blank"}.
  - Study the code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/modules/css/misc/advanced_css/assets/lecture-code){:target="_blank"}
  - Practice on CSS Grid by recreating the layouts depicted in the images found [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/modules/css/misc/advanced_css/assets/css-grid-practice){:target="_blank"}

  ---



  Next, we are going to explore some pretty useful and cool CSS features (that you probably didn't know exist). Let's go!

  - Go through [**this article**](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/advanced-css-tricks-and-techniques/){:target="_blank"} that covers quite a lot of features. For each one, you should check the appropriate MDN article for more details and play around with the feature in your local development environment. Perhaps it's a good idea at this point to create a file named `advanced-css-tricks.html` and work on it.

  The point of this module is to become aware and familiar with these really handy CSS tools. Unless you practice, of course, there's no point in moving forward, so let's use these tricks to build a web page that includes every single feature in the list.

  - **Responsive CSS Grids**
  - **Vertically Align with Flexbox**
  - **SVG for Icons and Logos**
  - **Masking**
  - **Shape Outside**
  - **Zoom on Hover**
  - **Scroll Snapping**
  - **Variable Fonts**
  - **Generate Text Animation**
  - **Initial Letter**
  - **Logical Properties and Values**
  - **CSS Subgrids**
  - **Smart Quotes in HTML/CSS**
  - **Comma-Separated Lists**
  - **Feature Query**
  - **Background Repeat**
  - **CSS Gradients**
  - **Truncate Strings**

  On top of that, you want to create a page that includes every single feature with a small description taken from the MDN docs and a small example (containing both the code used and the actual displayed output).

### Exercises

  - Build a replica of the [**var/let/const table**](./assets/var-let-const.jpg){:target="_blank"} using HTML and CSS. Sprinkle the table with some JavaScript if you feel like it.

  ![](./assets/var-let-const.jpg)

  You can use some emojis for the ❌ and ✅ or you can recreate them using plain CSS!

  - [Check Mark](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button){:target="_blank"}
  - [Cross Mark](https://emojipedia.org/cross-mark){:target="_blank"}

  If you go with the CSS route for the symbols, you can use the following HTML entities
  and find some CSS rules to apply colors, background, borders, circles, etc. to these characters


  - `<span>&check;</span>`
  - `<span>&CircleTimes;</span>`

  Refs:


  - [Unicode Character “⊗” (U+2297)](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2297){:target="_blank"}
  - [Unicode Character “✓” (U+2713)](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2713){:target="_blank"}

  You can of course, build the structure in many ways, but the `<table>` element is the most appropriate here.
  In case you've started building using another element, feel free to do so, and we'll check how different layouts
  and structure look later on.

  **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheet for this day is: **/user/week13/progress/progress.draft.w13.d04.csv**

  You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](../modules/curriculum/progress_workflow.md).
