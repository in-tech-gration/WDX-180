### Study Plan

  HTML elements can be distinguished by default into 2 broad categories, **block** and **inline** elements. This fundamental display property of HTML elements, affects their placement on the page and how they stack against each other. 

  Check this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHjoohto2-w) to learn about this display property of HTML elements and then head over to [**https://htmlreference.io/**](https://htmlreference.io/) to discover various block and inline elements, by unchecking all categories at the top, and selecting either the **inline** or **block** checkboxes. Once you've checked either of these categories to filter HTML elements, open up a couple of those elements and have a look at their syntax, use cases, available attributes and how they are displayed on a web page.
