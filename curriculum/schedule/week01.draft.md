**Welcome to the first part of our curriculum, WDX 60¬∞!** 

The goal of this first part, that will span 60 days, is to give you a basic understanding of how computers and the Internet work, how the World Wide Web _(or Web for short)_ which is built on top of them works and connects people and ideas together through the use of these **3 building blocks: HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. By the end of this part of the course, you'd be able to code in these 3 languages and deploy your websites and web applications on the Web.  

Before you dive in, **make sure that you have your notebook** and colored pens besides your computer, in order to pause and take those invaluable notes as you move along the curriculum.

At this point, it's extremely important to let you know that **sharing solutions** on Slack is **not allowed** and will be removed upon first notice. 

We encourage you to **help and support each other** but in a constructive and helpful manner: guiding other participants towards the right direction by asking questions, providing hints, suggesting alternatives and generally cultivating a problem solving mindset instead of depriving others of the capacity to process a problem by handing them a ready-made solution. 

### Setting up
