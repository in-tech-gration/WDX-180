  ## Handling different text directions

  Throughout this week, we have learned quite a lot about CSS, however it's just a small percentage of what CSS has to offer.

  On this weekend, we suggest that you get your hands on the following article:

  - [Read: **Handling different text directions**](resources/css_building_blocks/handling_different_text_directions/index.md)

  and after that you can test your knowledge on the subject with the exercise below:

  - [MDN's Assessment: **Test your skills: Writing modes and logical properties**](exercises/writing_modes_tasks/index.md)
