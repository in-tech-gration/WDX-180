# Test your skills: Values and units

_(Updated: 12/09/2023)_

The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand different types of [values and units used in CSS properties](../../resources/css_building_blocks/values_and_units/README.md).

> **Note:** If you get stuck, then ask us for help!

## Task 1

In this task, the first list item has been given a background color using a hex color code. Your task is to complete the CSS using the same color in different formats, plus a final list item where you should make the background semi-opaque.

- The second list item should use RGB color.
- The third should use HSL color.
- The fourth should use RGB color but with the alpha channel set to `0.6`.

You can find conversions for the hex color at [this link](https://convertingcolors.com/hex-color-86DEFA.html){:target="_blank"}. You need to figure out how to use the values in CSS.

Your final result should look like the image below:

## Task 2

In this task, we want you to set the size of various items of text, as described below:

- The `<h1>` element should be 50 pixels.
- The `<h2>` element should be 2em.
- All `<p>` elements should be 16 pixels.
- A `<p>` element that is directly after an `<h1>` should be 120%.

Your final result should look like the image below:

## Task 3

In this task, we want you to move the background image so that it is centered horizontally and is 20% from the top of the box.

[Download the starting point for this task](assets/position-download.html) to work in your own editor or in an online editor.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![A stat centered horizontally in a box and a short distance from the top of the box.](assets/mdn-value-position.png)
