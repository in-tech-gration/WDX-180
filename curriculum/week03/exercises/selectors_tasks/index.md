- Make `<h1>` headings blue.
- Give `<h2>` headings a blue background and white text.
- Cause text wrapped in a `<span>` to have a font-size of 200%.

In this task, we want you to make the following changes to the look of the content in this example, without changing the HTML:

- Give the element with an id of `special` a yellow background.
- Give the element with a class of `alert` a 1px grey border.
- If the element with a class of `alert` also has a class of `stop`, make the background red.
- If the element with a class of `alert` also has a class of `go`, make the background green.

## Task 5

In this task, add CSS using attribute selectors to do the following:

- Target the `<a>` element with a `title` attribute and make the border pink (`border-color: pink`).
- Target the `<a>` element with an `href` attribute that contains the word `contact` somewhere in its value and make the border orange (`border-color: orange`).
- Target the `<a>` element with an `href` value starting with `https` and give it a green border (`border-color: green`).

Your final result should look like the image below:
