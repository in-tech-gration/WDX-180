# Test your skills: The box model

_(Updated: 07/09/2023)_

The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand the [CSS box model](../../resources/css_building_blocks/the_box_model/index.md).

> **Note:** If you get stuck, then ask us for help!

## Task 1

In this task, there are two boxes below, one is using the standard box model, the other the alternate box model. Change the width of the second box by adding declarations to the `.alternate` class, so that it matches the visual width of the first box.

## Task 3

In this task, the inline element has a margin, padding and border. However, the lines above and below are overlapping it. What can you add to your CSS to cause the size of the margin, padding, and border to be respected by the other lines, while still keeping the element inline?
