# Test your skills: Backgrounds and borders

_(Updated: 12/09/2023)_

The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand [backgrounds and borders of boxes in CSS](../../resources/css_building_blocks/backgrounds_and_borders/README.md).

> **Note:** If you get stuck, then ask us for help!

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to add a background, border, and some simple styling to a page header:

1. Give the box a 5px black solid border, with rounded corners of 10px.
2. Add a background image (use the URL `balloons.jpg`) and size it so that it covers the box.
3. Give the `<h2>` a semi-transparent black background color, and make the text white.

Your final result should look like the image below:

## Task 2

In this task, we want you to add background images, a border, and some other styling to a decorative box:

- Give the box a 5px lightblue border and round the top left corner 20px and the bottom right corner 40px.
- The heading uses the `star.png` image as a background image, with a single centered star on the left and a repeating pattern of stars on the right.
- Make sure that the heading text does not overlay the image, and that it is centered â€” you will need to use techniques learned in previous lessons to achieve this.
