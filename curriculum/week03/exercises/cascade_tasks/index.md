# Test your skills: The Cascade

_(Updated: 07/09/2023)_

The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand universal property values for [controlling inheritance in CSS](../../resources/css_building_blocks/cascade_and_inheritance/index.md).

> **Note:** If you get stuck, then ask us for help!

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to use one of the special values we looked at in the [controlling inheritance](../../resources/css_building_blocks/cascade_and_inheritance/index.md#controlling-inheritance) section. To write a declaration in a new rule that will reset the background color back to white, without using an actual color value.

[Download the starting point for this task](assets/cascade-download.html) to work in your own editor or in an online editor.

Your final result should look like the image below:

## Task 2

In this task, we want you to make your changes by leveraging the [order of cascade layers](../../resources/css_building_blocks/cascade_and_inheritance/index.md#order-of-cascade-layers) section. Edit an existing declaration, without touching the lightgreen declaration, using the cascade layer order to make the links rebeccapurple.

Your final result should look like the image below:
