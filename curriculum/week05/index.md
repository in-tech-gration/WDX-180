### Study Plan

**What is a CSS Framework**

  A CSS framework is a prepped and ready-to-use CSS library (Cascading Style Sheets). The stylesheets collection makes the job of a UI developer **easier**. 

  Rather than starting every project from scratch, a CSS framework gives them tools to quickly create a user interface that they repeat and tweak during a project. They also **enable the creation** of more **standards-compliant** websites. 

  While quite challenging to use or ambiguous for beginners, senior developers who know the CSS framework sites’ descriptions and buzzwords find them extremely useful.

**Why Do You Need A CSS Framework?**

  CSS frameworks **are designed for use in typical scenarios** such as establishing navigation bars, footers, sliders, hamburger menus, 3-column layouts, and more. 

  The frameworks also **enable expanding on JavaScript, SASS, and other technologies**. If designers are time-stressed, frameworks allow setting up web pages – not just homepages, without diving into some CSS.

  Other than time-saving, teams comprising several developers benefit from the standards offered by CSS frameworks. Rather than each developer on a project adding their own style of names, frameworks regulate layouts, easily read others’ code, and smooth the development cycle with fewer bugs and better team communication.

  All of the above are the two strongest **pros** of working with a CSS Framework: **Faster Development** and **Consistency**

  However, as you already know, every coin has 2 sides. Using any CSS Framework can have it's drawbacks and not be suitable for some cases as described below:

  1. **Bloated Code**

  CSS frameworks include a lot of pre-built styles and components, which can add unnecessary code to a website or application. This can slow down the website's loading time and negatively impact performance. Additionally, using pre-built components can limit the customization options available to developers and tempt developers to use them without fully understanding how they work.

  2. **Learning Curve**

  Each CSS framework has its own set of styles, components, and conventions that developers need to learn in order to use it effectively. This can take time and effort, especially for developers who are new to front-end development. Additionally, CSS frameworks may not always align with a developer's preferred workflow or coding style. This can make it challenging to use the framework effectively, especially if the developer is used to writing custom CSS from scratch.

### Summary

  CSS Frameworks are so popular these days and they get better and better as time goes by. However, just because they make things easier and faster for some cases, that does not mean that we should ditch plain CSS and restrain our options and imagination to what each CSS Framework has to offer.

  Finally, it's highly suggested that you take a look on the following link focused on [Understanding the spectrum of CSS frameworks](https://dev.to/bholmesdev/when-and-why-you-should-use-css-frameworks-4oe)

<!-- Exercises -->

  Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheet for this day is: **/user/week05/progress/progress.draft.w05.d01.csv**

  You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](../week01/resources/PROGRESS-WORKFLOW.md).
